After McClanahan and her husband thanked Arthur for inviting them to her performance, things heated up.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McClanahan shared with the audience</a> that Arthur took one of her long pauses, looked at McClanahan’s husband, and said, “I love Rue! Betty [White] is a cunt!”</p><p>This was not the first time that the public had become aware of the tension between the co-stars, but it was the first time one of the Golden Girls ever spoke about one another in that way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=betty-white-rsquo-s-thoughts-on-her-relationship-with-bea-arthur>Betty White’s Thoughts On Her Relationship With Bea Arthur</h2><p>Betty White didn’t have a lot to say about her relationship with Bea Arthur for years after The Golden Girls ended.

Sometimes if I was happy, she’d be furious!”</p><p>Although White’s comments about her relationship with her co-star don’t reveal exactly why the two weren’t close, it clearly seems that the ladies may have just had two big, different personalities that didn’t allow them to mesh together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bea-arthur-and-rue-mcclanahan-were-close-friends>Bea Arthur And Rue McClanahan Were Close Friends</h2><p>Bea Arthur and Rue McClanahan met each other while filming the TV series All in the Family and its spin-off, Maude.</p><p>In the same tribute to Bea Arthur, McClanahan spoke about her former co-star’s softer side as she reflected on the comfort and support Arthur provided for her when McClanahan’s mother passed away during the first season of Maude.</p><p>According to McClanahan’s story, she called Arthur after learning about her mom’s passing. The Golden Girl invited her co-star over to stay the night, made up the guest bedroom, and laid next to McClanahan for hours to provide comfort.</p><p>In her speech, McClanahan said, “I felt for the first time in six days a feeling of peace coming over me.
