Among many allegations, <a href=#>she claimed her father forced her on medication</a> and abused her finances, and says her mom say by and watched it happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney was reportedly furious with her entire family after it was lifted, causing her to cut off all contact –<a href=#> she didn’t even invite her immediate family to her 2022 wedding to Sam Asghari</a>. She also hasn’t been afraid to call them out on social media, further increasing speculation around Britney’s relationship with her family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Britney Spears Really Felt About Her Controversial Interview With Diane Swayer</a></span></p><p>“My family ruined my dreams 100 billion per cent and try to make me look like the crazy one while I have a 104 degree fever, not being able to move in my bed,” Britney wrote on Instagram last year. “My family loves to pull me down and hurt me always so I am disgusted with them.”</p><p>However, new reports say that Britney has begun talking to certain family members, so it could be a sign that a full-blown reconciliation is on the horizon. But this begs the question as to what made Britney change her mind about her family after everything she’s been through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-hopes-to-get-a-ldquo-public-apology-rdquo-from-her-family>Britney Hopes To Get A “Public Apology” From Her Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Britney-Spears-Almost-Got-A-“Boob-Job”-After-Her-Dad-Jamie-Body-Shamed-Her.jpg><p>It wasn’t surprising when Britney stopped communicating with her family after her conservatorship was lifted in 2021. She accused her mother and father of facilitating abuse, financial and otherwise, and alleged her sister Britney Lynn Spears was complicit in keeping her under a legal chokehold. Britney once said she was under such tight control, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wasn’t allowed to remove her IUD or get married under the conservatorship</a>.</p><p>Given what she went through, it’s surprising that recent reports say the pop star is giving some family members a second chance, though she’s still apparently hesitant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She has started talking to different members of her family, like her brother [Bryan Spears] and her mom [Lynne Spears], but there are still trust issues," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told The Messenger</a> last month.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has Britney Spears Seen Her Sons Since Her Conservatorship Ended?</a></span></p><p>However, that doesn’t mean Britney has forgiven and forgotten her family’s actions. The same insider said that Britney is hoping for a public apology from her loved ones. "She has felt exploited and she would like it if they took some responsibility and issued a public apology,” the source went on.</p><p>Britney’s mother Lynne is apparently eager to improve their relationship, though the singer is reportedly still refusing to speak to her father, Jamie Spears, who was her legal conservator for over a decade.</p><p>"Britney is not in touch with her father. Her mother Lynne has reached out and they have had a few conversations in the last few months," a different source told The Messenger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Lynne would love to repair the relationship and Britney is becoming more open to it. She loves her Mom, but a lot of damage has been done and [Britney] has distanced herself,” they added.</p><h2 id=britney-rsquo-s-relationship-with-her-sons-suffered-amid-family-problems>Britney’s Relationship With Her Sons Suffered Amid Family Problems</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/whatsapp-image-2023-02-26-at-7-35-42-pm.jpeg><p>It’s<strong> </strong>possible that Britney isn’t talking to her family only for her sake, but also for that of her teenage sons, Sean, 17, and Jayden, 16. The singer’s relationship with her boys reportedly suffered amid her public feud with her family. One report claims the teens have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">refusing to see their famous mother for over a year</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Only months after Sean and Jayden refused to attend Britney’s June 2022 nuptials to Sam Asghari, Jayden gave his first <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">public interview to Daily Mail </a>in which he criticized Britney’s parenting. “I think Mom has struggled giving us both attention and showing us equal love; I don’t think she showed enough to Preston, and I feel really bad for that,” the teen said.</p><p>The boys’ father, Kevin Federline, also mentioned in the interview that Britney’s racy social media posts have also caused their sons to want to distance themselves.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Close Are Britney Spears’ Sons To Their Cousin, Jamie-Lynn Spears’ Daughter?</a></span></p><p>“I try to explain to them, ‘Look, maybe that’s just another way she tries to express herself.’ But that doesn’t take away from the fact of what it does to them,” Kevin explained. “It’s tough. I can’t imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney may hope that repairing things with her family could have a positive impact on her relationship with her sons. And amid <a href=#>reports the boys are moving to Hawaii</a> with their father, Britney has more motivation than ever to keep her loved ones close by.</p><h2 id=britney-wants-more-kids-amp-may-want-them-to-know-her-family>Britney Wants More Kids & May Want Them To Know Her Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/britney-spears-and-son.jpg><p>Finally, Britney may also be thinking towards the future. The singer has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vocal about her desire to start a family</a> with her long-time partner, Sam Asghari, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he’s also expressed similar hopes</a>.</p><p>The couple even announced Britney was pregnant in 2022, only for them to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal she miscarried a few weeks later</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not known if Britney and Sam are actively trying to expand their family, but if that’s still the plan, the pop star may want to mend things with her family beforehand so she can have them in her children’s lives.</p><p>Or, at the very least, she wants to clear the air so she can focus on the future. In either case, no one can blame Britney for wanting to be involved with some of her family, even if they do owe her a very big apology.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gko7K6edKpnJqqo2K2tHnTmqOkoZ6cerW7jKGcq2WWlrqquNhmmKCZmaN6o8HTZq6hmaRiuqKwxGafnqpdmLWiusaeZKGdomK6qrrDaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-is-talking-to-her-family-again-but-what-made-her-change-her-mind.html&text=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Talking%20To%20Her%20Family%20Again%2c%20But%20What%20Made%20Her%20Change%20Her%20Mind%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-is-talking-to-her-family-again-but-what-made-her-change-her-mind.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-is-talking-to-her-family-again-but-what-made-her-change-her-mind.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Talking%20To%20Her%20Family%20Again%2c%20But%20What%20Made%20Her%20Change%20Her%20Mind%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbritney-spears-is-talking-to-her-family-again-but-what-made-her-change-her-mind.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Talking%20To%20Her%20Family%20Again%2c%20But%20What%20Made%20Her%20Change%20Her%20Mind%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-is-talking-to-her-family-again-but-what-made-her-change-her-mind.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Talking%20To%20Her%20Family%20Again%2c%20But%20What%20Made%20Her%20Change%20Her%20Mind%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-is-talking-to-her-family-again-but-what-made-her-change-her-mind.html&description=Britney%20Spears%20Is%20Talking%20To%20Her%20Family%20Again%2c%20But%20What%20Made%20Her%20Change%20Her%20Mind%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fans-think-shakira-destroyed-her-boyfriend-in-this-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans Think Shakira 'Destroyed' Her Boyfriend In This Interview">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hadley-anderson-obituary-insights-into-her-life-dreams-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hadley Anderson Obituary: Insights Into Her Life, Dreams, &amp;amp; Death">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
