She is well known as the wife of Dirk Werner Nowitzki, a retired professional German NBA player who was in the DJK Würzburg basketball club.</strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-wiki-jessica-olsson-wiki></span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Wiki | Jessica Olsson Wiki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Dirk Nowitzki’s wife, Jessica Olsson, was born in Nanyuki, Kenya and raised in Sweden alongside her younger twin brothers. She grew up with a love for sports as her footballer brothers played soccer from a very young age and often took their sister with them to watch and occasionally play the game. Her tribal Kenyan language is Gikuyu.</p><p>Despite holding different nationalities, the duo and their kids are residents of the United States where Jessica Olsson works. Besides, they are in the process of becoming citizens of the US. The family travels once or twice a year to Kenya to visit their relatives and acquaint their kids with their mom’s heritage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-age-jessica-olsson-age></span><span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Age | Jessica Olsson Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nowitzki’s wife is 37 years old as of 2019 making her 4 years younger than her famous husband who was born on June 19, 1978.

Her family relocated to Sweden when she was still very young. Therefore, she is a Swedish as well as a Kenyan citizen.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-height-jessica-olsson-height></span><span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Height | Jessica Olsson Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Looking at their pictures, you will notice a visible difference in height between Jessica Olsson and her husband. Dirk Nowitzki’s wife stands at 1.54 meters tall which is way shorter than her husband’s height measured at 2.10 meters.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-education></span><span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Growing up in Europe, Jessica Olsson attended the best schools in Sweden from her kindergarten to high school. Afterward, she probably enrolled in college in other European countries or in the United States. The names of the institutions she schooled at have not yet been revealed and we will update you once we verify the information.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-family></span><span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-parents-jessica-olsson-parents></span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Parents | Jessica Olsson Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jessica Nowitzki has a Kenyan ancestry from her mother’s side and a Swedish descent from her father.</p><p>Her mother, the late Maggie Olsson, comes from Nanyuki, Kenya and is of the Gikuyu tribe. She got married to a Swede, Mr. Olsson, who has managed to stay low key away from the spotlight, despite having famous children.</p><p>Maggie Olsson held a traditional engagement ceremony in Nanyuki back when Nowitzki proposed to Jessica. She lived long enough to see her daughter become a wife and a mother but passed away at an undisclosed date.</p><p>On the other hand, Jessica Olsson’s in-laws are celebrated sports stars in the respective games they played. Her mother-in-law, Helga Nowitzki, was a professional basketball player whereas her father-in-law, Jörg-Werner, was an international handball player.</p><p>As of her sister-in-law, Dirk Nowitzki’s older sister Silke Nowitzki, she is a former local champion in basketball as well as track and field who now works for the NBA in International TV.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-siblings></span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Dirk Nowitzki’s wife is the eldest of three children born to a Swedish dad and a Kenyan mom. Her younger brothers, <strong>Marcus Olsson</strong> and <strong>Martin Olsson</strong> are twins and professional footballers who play for the Swedish national team. The twins were born on 17 May 1988, 6 years later after their elder sister was born.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-jessica-olsson-and-dirk-nowitzki></span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife | Jessica Olsson and Dirk Nowitzki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jessica Olsson is married to <strong>Dirk Nowitzki</strong>. The couple tied their knot on July 20, 2012, at Nowitzki’s home in Dallas and together they are blessed with three children namely, Morris, Malaika, and Max. The family resides in Dallas, Texas.</p><p>Dirk Nowitzki and his wife are an example of love at first sight. They met at a charity event in Dallas organized by a Senegal based nonprofit, Sports for Education and Economic Development (SEED) in February 2010. During the event held at night, Nowitzki made a major donation in exchange for a Rolando Diaz painting. Besides, he agreed to go on two dates for charity and later asked Jesicca out on a date too.</p><p>Since then, the couple dated for a few years before they exchanged their nuptial vows. Race has never been an issue to them despite the race-related comments they got from people when they made their first major public appearance at The ESPYS awards red carpet on July 13, 2011.</p><p><strong>Jessica Olsson Wedding</strong></p><p>The attractive couple had two weddings, first in Kenya and later in Germany. There are no many details to share about the Germany-held wedding since it was the normal wedding routine that the duo is aware of. That is, a facilitator blessed their union and officiated the ceremony.</p><p>In Kenya, Jessica Olsson’s mother held a traditional Kikuyu wedding for her daughter and son-in-law. Hundreds of people were in attendance and witnessed the retired NBA player correctly choose his bride among 6 other women while blindfolded. The practice is orthodox at Kikuyu weddings and for each wrong pick the groom makes, he purchases a goat for slaughter.</p><p>The Kenyan-held ceremony went on for a whole day with more practices being introduced to Dirk and Jessica as they were new experiences to both of them.</p><p>Another common practice at such weddings is the dowry payment well known as “ruracio”. The grooms pay a certain agreed-upon amount of money or property to the bride’s parents. In Dirk’s case, he was given a little Kenyan shilling and paid them that. Jessica Olsson wore a traditional Kikuyu garment while Dirk Nowitzki was in a dark brown traditional outfit with orange hues.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-and-kids-jessica-olsson-children></span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife and Kids | Jessica Olsson Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Since their marriage in 2012, Nowitzki’s family has grown as his wife has given birth to three beautiful kids, a daughter, and two sons.

Besides, she has not revealed her net worth as she is a simple person and never likes to attract public attention by publicly displaying her wealth. However, this section is under review, we will update you when details about her salary figures and net worth are revealed.</p><p>Bearing in mind that one of their marriage vows state that they are together as one, we can comfortably conclude that Nowitzki shares his net worth that amounts to an estimated sum of $140 million with his wife.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-facts-and-body-measurements></span><span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Facts and Body Measurements</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Full Name:&nbsp;</strong>Jessica Olsson</li><li><strong>Age/ How Old?:&nbsp;</strong>37</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>1982</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Place of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>Nanyuki, Kenya</li><li><strong>Education‎:&nbsp;</strong>In Sweden</li><li><strong>Birthday:&nbsp;</strong>Not Available</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Nationality: </strong>Swedish-Kenyan</li><li><strong>Father’s Name: </strong>Mr. Olsson</li><li><strong>Mother’s Name: </strong>Maggie Olsson</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Siblings: </strong>Two brothers</li><li><strong>Married?:&nbsp;</strong>Dirk Nowitzki</li><li><strong>Children/ Kids:&nbsp;</strong>A daughter and 2 sons</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Height/ How tall?:&nbsp;</strong>1.54 m</li><li><strong>Weight:&nbsp;</strong>63 kg</li><li><strong>Profession: </strong>Associate director</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-career></span><span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nowitzki’s wife has been an art lover throughout her life. As a result, she has worked for art galleries and companies both in Germany and the United States of America. For her to meet with the love of her life at a charitable event, she must also be a philanthropist who works with several organizations to develop underprivileged situations.</p><p>What Dirk Nowitzki’s wife does for a living is of no question considering that she is an art fanatic. Jessica Olsson works at the Goss-Michael Foundation as an associate producer. The foundation is a 501(c)(3) charitable arts organization serving the Dallas community.</p><p>The Goss-Michael Foundation was established in 2007 by Kenny Goss and the deceased music icon, George Michael.

The to-go plate is the kind that a person is sent home with when there are leftovers remaining from a party or dinner.</p><p>Dirk Nowitzki is very choosy when it comes to what he takes in as food. He has a diet he is adhering to and that is why he brings his own food from home. His loving wife is responsible for the to-go plate which her husband is often seen carrying.</p><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Dirk Nowitzki Wife</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-dirk-nowitzkis-wife></span><span>Who is Dirk Nowitzki’s Wife?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jessica Olsson is&nbsp;an accomplished associate director who has gained extensive recognition as the wife of famous retired German NBA player, Dirk Nowitzki</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-dirk-nowitzkis-wife></span><span>How old is Dirk Nowitzki’s Wife?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is a Swedish-Kenyan national born in 1982, in Nanyuki, Kenya.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-dirk-nowitzkis-wife></span><span>How tall is Dirk Nowitzki’s Wife?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dirk Nowitzki’s wife stands at a height of 1.54 meters.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-jessica-olsson-married></span><span>Is Jessica Olsson married?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, she is married to Dirk Nowitzki.
