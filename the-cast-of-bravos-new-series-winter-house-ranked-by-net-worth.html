Not in the sort of Game Of Thrones way you may be thinking though. There are no swords and dragons this time around, it's more of a hot tubs and shotski sort of show. This winter, Bravo is bringing fans the collaboration of their dreams. <a href=#>Summer House and Southern Charm have banded together</a> at a house in Vermont for almost three weeks for this six-episode mashup. The expectations are high since Bravo combined two of their most highly rated series. There is no doubt there will be lots of love triangles, tears, and drunken squabbles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About The ‘Southern Charm’ And ‘Summer House’ Mashup Series</a></span></p><p>If there is anything all these reality contestants know how to do it is party. Winter House is exactly what Bravo needs right now to lighten the mood. Fans have missed the Summer House crew including Kyle Cooke, Amanda Batula, Paige DeSorbo, Lindsay Hubbard, Luke Gulbranson, and Ciara Miller. Some missing from the new series are Carl Radke and <a href=#>Danielle Olivera </a>who are sure to be on the next season of Summer House. Pals Craig Conover and Austen Kroll are representing some Southern Charm action and fans couldn't be more excited. The<a href=#> success of these shows </a>has gotten the far in their careers. Let's take a look at where these individuals stand financially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=craig-conover-400-000><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Craig Conover: $400,000</span></h2><p>Craig is no rookie when it comes to reality television and has been a part of the Southern Charm family since 2014. Fans are eager to see how his relationship with Paige DeSorbo unfolds in real-time. Another behind-the-scenes cross-over that is happening is between Craig and Vanderpump Rules star Tom Sandoval. Exciting stuff is in store for the Bravo universe!</p><h2 id=ciara-miller-600-000><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Ciara Miller: $600,000</span></h2><p><a href=#>Ciara is a successful model and ICU nurse</a> when she is not appearing on reality television. She worked on the frontlines during the COVID-19 outbreak and deserves this much-needed vacation to the winter house!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luke-gulbranson-600-000><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Luke Gulbranson: $600,000</span></h2><p>Luke is one of the most multifaceted cast members on Bravo. He is a model, hockey instructor, and jewelry designer. Luke has also dabbled in acting making appearances on shows like The Flight Attendant and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, and films such as By My Hand.</p><h2 id=paige-desorbo-1-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Paige DeSorbo: $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paige is the fashion guru and iconic one-liner gal pal of Summer House. It is no surprise she has made her way over to this wintery fortress. Paige has over 500,000 followers and has <a href=#>earned herself a nice chunk of change</a>. She is arguably the most popular cast member to come out of the franchise and it seems like there is only up for her. Paige runs a podcast called "The Giggly Squad" as well as a fashion blog for Betches Media. On the side, she hosts a show on Amazon Live and shares her fashion secrets. Recently, <a href=#>Paige confirmed a relationship with none other than Southern Charm's favorite bachelor Craig Conover</a>. Unfortunately, this romance will not play out on the show because all the magic happened off-screen.</p><h2 id=amanda-batula-1-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Amanda Batula: $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amanda mixed the two things you almost never mix together... orange juice and chai! Just kidding, what she really mixed was work and pleasure. Amanda is newly married to Kyle Cooke and they own a hard tea beverage line together. It all began in the summer of 2018 during season 3 of the hit reality show. <a href=#>Loverboy, Inc. has done pretty well considering how competitive the alcohol industry is</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Southern Charm' Fans Want A Craig Conover & Naomie Olindo Reconciliation After Her Messy Split</a></span></p><h2 id=austen-kroll-1-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Austen Kroll: $1 Million</span></h2><p>One half of Southern Charm's current bromance is the one and only Austen Kroll. Kroll created his own line of craft beer called Trop Hop back in 2019. Business is booming and it is time for this lad to let loose!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gabrielle-kniery-1-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Gabrielle Kniery: $1 Million</span></h2><p>Before her debut on Bravo's new show Winter House, Kniery was a contestant on America's Next Top Model. Thankfully this is not a competition show because she was the first one voted out on ANTM. Luckily, her modeling career kicked off without the help of Tyra Banks and she has been in the industry ever since.</p><h2 id=kyle-cooke-1-1-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kyle Cooke: $1.1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kyle Cooke brought his girlfriend and now wife Amanda on board for his "Loverboy" idea and it has been a success ever since. Kyle has accomplished a lot as an entrepreneur but still finds time to party. It will be interesting to see how he juggles business life and married life.</p><h2 id=lindsay-hubbard-1-1-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lindsay Hubbard: $1.1 Million</span></h2><p>Lindsay is a boss girl and is currently the Founder and President of her firm "Hubb House Public Relations." She along with Kyle Cooke are the only OG members of Summer House left. It is no surprise that she has amassed this impressive net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Could Season 8 Of ‘Southern Charm’ Look Like?</a></span></p><h2 id=julia-mcguire-unknown><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Julia Mcguire: Unknown</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Julia is a new addition to the franchise and she is very close friends with Paige DeSorbo. These two have been good friends since they were kids so it will be interesting to see Paige's new friends and old friends collide. Julia is a model and runs in the same circle as another new kid on the block... male model Andrea Denver. Mcguire will be avoiding any wintery romances on the show since she is already in a committed relationship.</p><h2 id=jason-cameron-unknown><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jason Cameron: Unknown</span></h2><p>Cameron is another new face of the series and is also a model like his fellow newbies. Casting directors were clearly searching in the same pool when they found all the new cast members, but fans are not complaining. Jason also works for an NYC-based non-profit organization that empowers youth by bringing change through style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andrea-denver-1-million-to-5-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Andrea Denver: $1 Million To $5 Million</span></h2><p>Lastly, it's Andrea Denver who knows Julia as well as Lindsay Hubbard and Ciara Miller. In the Winter House trailer, Denver is shown cozying up to Paigey! Andrea is an Italian model who has also been featured in both JLo's music video "I Luh Ya Papi," and Taylor Swift's music video "Blank Space."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>‘Vanderpump Rules’: Ariana Madix Slams Lala Kent For Posting A Photo With Stassi And Kristen</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmK60wIyonWaaopbDsL%2BMp5ywZaOav6qx0mauoqakmr9utM6uqp5lopa7rLHDZpmyZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-cast-of-bravos-new-series-winter-house-ranked-by-net-worth.html&text=The%20Cast%20Of%20Bravo%27s%20New%20Series%20%27Winter%20House%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-cast-of-bravos-new-series-winter-house-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-cast-of-bravos-new-series-winter-house-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20Bravo%27s%20New%20Series%20%27Winter%20House%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-cast-of-bravos-new-series-winter-house-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20Bravo%27s%20New%20Series%20%27Winter%20House%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-cast-of-bravos-new-series-winter-house-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20Bravo%27s%20New%20Series%20%27Winter%20House%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-cast-of-bravos-new-series-winter-house-ranked-by-net-worth.html&description=The%20Cast%20Of%20Bravo%27s%20New%20Series%20%27Winter%20House%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1923-season-1-episode-6-recap-one-ocean-closer-to-destiny-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="1923 Recap: Whats in a Name?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rashad-little-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-607067-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rashad Little Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
