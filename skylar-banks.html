Lil was only 25 years old when Skyler was born. Due to Durk&nbsp;disloyalty towards his partner, their relationship did not work out, and they parted ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/5/31/190472109_782613349282094_5680528387471043891_n(1)-min-1622464882526.jpg><p>Currently, the celebrity kid's dad Durk is leading a single life after being separated from his long-term girlfriend turned fiancee, India Royale.</p><h2>What Happened Between Durk & India?</h2><p>Lil Durk and India Royale initially started dating each other in 2017.

His mother raised him with his two sisters and brother.&nbsp;</p><p>The kid's father (<strong>Dontay Banks</strong>) went to jail when he was only seven months old, and his mother did what she could to feed them. Due to this reason, he started making mixtapes rap collective named&nbsp;<i>Only the Family</i>&nbsp;at the early age of ten and uploaded them on&nbsp;<i>Myspace</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>YouTube</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>But sadly, in <i>2011</i>, police arrested him for weapon possession and put him into jail for three months.
