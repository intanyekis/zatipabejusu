It's been particularly interesting to follow along with the careers of The Vampire Diaries actors because they have each had very different journeys. Some of <a href=#>Nina Dobrev's movies have flopped</a>, which has been a surprise for fans since she became famous for playing sweet teenager Elena Gilbert. Other stars like <a href=#>Steven R. McQueen have starred in several movies and TV shows</a> that have been hits.</p><p>Sara Canning is one of the most beloved stars of The Vampire Diaries and she has also lived a compelling life after wrapping her time up on the popular show. She played Jeremy and Elena Gilbert's charming aunt Jenna Sommers in 46 episodes.

She was a main cast member in The Vampire Diaries in seasons 1 and 2 and then came back for several episodes later on. Most of her episodes aired from 2009 to 2014, and then she returned in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-vampire-diaries-sara-canning-nina-dobrev.jpg><p>While the actress is most recognized for playing Jenna, she did have a few starring roles in other TV series. Since she is Canadian, she has been working steadily in Canadian productions ever since she first began acting. Before playing Jenna Sommers in The Vampire Diaries, she starred in the Canadian movie Black Field, which was released in 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/was-there-a-pay-gap-on-the-vampire-diaries_-here-s-how-much-paul-wesley-nina-dobrev-and-ian-somerhalder-were-paid.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Would Nina Dobrev Return To The Franchise After Quitting 'Vampire Diaries' Early?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nina Dobrev left The Vampire Diaries early, but she might be willing to return to the franchise.</span><p>From 2014 to 2015, Canning played Dr. Melissa Connor in Remedy, a Canadian hospital drama. The show aired for two seasons on Global and focused on the Connor family who all work at Bethune General Hospital.</p><p>From 2017 to 2018, she played Jacquelyn in the <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> series Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events. It was cool to see the actress take on both of these roles as they are so different from each other. Canning is always an incredibly likable actress, and that was true even when she played the dark character of Jacquelyn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-vampire-diaries-sara-canning.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sara Canning talked about these TV shows</a> in an interview with Vancouver Is Awesome.

She said, “It was the most fantastical experience. Every day I would go to work and I probably seemed totally crazy, because I’d be looking at everyone going, ‘Is this really work? What are we doing?’ I’d be just losing my mind in a corner somewhere. The costumes blew my mind. The sets were unbelievable. Neil Patrick Harris [who portrays Count Olaf] is not of this earth.

While she does have an Instagram account and is fairly active, there isn't a lot of information out there about her personal life. The Vampire Diaries fans who are eager to know if the actress is dating anyone will come up empty if they search for that answer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/what-actually-happened-to-sara-canning-after-the-vampire-diaries-ended_-here-s-the-truth-about-what-she-s-doing-now.jpg><p>However, she does seem to be very happy. In August 2023, Canning shared on Instagram that she was proud of having starred in the movie Sweetland. The film is adapted from the book by Newfoundland author Michael Crummey and tells the sad story of Moses, a fisherman who doesn't want to move away from his home, but who has been told by the government that he has to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Vampire-Diaries-Featured-Image.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nina Dobrev Nearly Missed Getting Her Big Role In The Vampire Diaries</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nina Dobrev almost turned down 'The Vampire Diaries' for another big project.</span><p>While the actress has only said yes to a few projects in the past few years, it seems that she chooses stories that feel right to hear. In 2022, she starred in the thriller Influencer, and in 2021, she appeared in the holiday movie A Christmas Star.</p><p>Sara Canning's Canadian identity seems very near and dear to her heart. In 2013, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canning talked about Vancouver</a> in an interview with The Globe and Mail and she talked about calling the city her home base. She was born in Gandor, Newfoundland and spent time in Edmonton, Alberta as a child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sara-canning-2.jpg><p>She shared that she was enjoying being in Vancouver and said, "It's really settled into my bones. I'm at the point now where when I get off the plane in Vancouver, I just sigh. I'm so blessed to be bicoastal. I'm just at home here as I am in Newfoundland. We're really close to Stanley Park, which I love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's unclear what Sara Canning's acting career will look like in the future, she seems to have been working regularly since The Vampire Diaries.
