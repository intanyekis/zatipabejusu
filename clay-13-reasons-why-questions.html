But that being said, we completely separate the actor from the character he plays here. According to public interviews and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his social media pages</a>,&nbsp;Dylan Minnette&nbsp;is a great guy with a great heart.

He also makes some questionable choices and between season one and season three of 13 Reasons Why, we have 13 questions we'd like to ask.</p><h2 id=why-didn-t-clay-report-tyler-down-for-almost-shooting-up-a-school-dance><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Why Didn't Clay Report Tyler Down For Almost Shooting Up A School Dance?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13reasons-1.jpg><p>Tyler Down showed up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the high school dance</a> with a bag full of weapons and what did Clay Jensen do?

Clay Jensen on the other hand? It took him an entire season to listen to all of the tapes. Obviously, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">show creators from Netflix</a> decided to split up the tapes into separate episodes to create the proper setup of the story, so we do understand why it worked out the way it did.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-judge-hannah-baker-for-sleeping-with-zach><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Why Did Clay Judge Hannah Baker For Sleeping With Zach?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hannah.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clay Jensen put Hannah Baker on such an unrealistically high pedestal as if she was meant to be some untouched and undefiled flower. Clay judged her beyond words after finding out that she swiped her V-card with Zach. In reality, it was&nbsp;just fine for Hannah Baker to hook up with Zach. She and Zach connected, Zach was always respectful of her, and her choice to become sexually active should not have warranted judgment– from anyone.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-try-victim-blaming-shaming-in-regards-to-the-clubhouse><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Why Did Clay Try Victim Blaming/Shaming In Regards To The Clubhouse?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13reasons.png><p>After seeing photos of girls being taken advantage of in the clubhouse controlled by the football players, Clay Jensen had the audacity to ask why girls get themselves into these types of predicaments. Sheri shut him down real quick when she said, "Clay, you don't know what was happening in this photo and you don't know what happened after. Girls don't get themselves into bad situations. Guys make the situations bad. You don't know what that feels like, to be a girl in that room."

Justin did not want to get hooked on drugs and ruin his life forever.</p><h2 id=why-didn-t-clay-contact-hannah-s-parents-sooner><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Why Didn't Clay Contact Hannah's Parents Sooner?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13reasons2.jpeg><p>As soon as Clay Jensen was made aware of the tapes, the first thing he should have done was go straight to Hannah's parents (or the police) with every single one of them.

He needs the help of a therapist right away after everything he has been through. He went through grief and mourning after losing Hannah, the end of his relationship with Skye, the rejection of Ani, the process of listening to those tapes, the process of trying to take Bryce down in court, and worst of all... the feeling of guilt weighing on his shoulders for Hannah's death.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-try-to-make-hannah-into-someone-she-s-not><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Why Did Clay Try To Make Hannah Into Someone She's Not?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hannah-clay.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is one of the biggest questions we have.

The way it all perfectly wrapped up worked out in Alex Standall's favor because Alex is actually the one who killed him. Our question is, why did Clay go along with that when he is always so uppity about truth, honesty, integrity, etc. Sometimes he cares about being noble, moralistic, and upright... and other times he doesn't?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Reasons Why: Ranking The Most Intense Moments From Season 1 To 3</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiapZmpYn50edGemKynnqh6uLTYZqiunaOptrC60mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fclay-13-reasons-why-questions.html&text=All%20The%20Questions%20We%20Have%20About%20Clay%20From%2013%20Reasons%20Why&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclay-13-reasons-why-questions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclay-13-reasons-why-questions.html&title=All%20The%20Questions%20We%20Have%20About%20Clay%20From%2013%20Reasons%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fclay-13-reasons-why-questions.html&title=All%20The%20Questions%20We%20Have%20About%20Clay%20From%2013%20Reasons%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fclay-13-reasons-why-questions.html&title=All%20The%20Questions%20We%20Have%20About%20Clay%20From%2013%20Reasons%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclay-13-reasons-why-questions.html&description=All%20The%20Questions%20We%20Have%20About%20Clay%20From%2013%20Reasons%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./frank-fontsere.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Frank Fontsere">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./yolanda-duckie-debarge-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-131141-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yolanda Duckie DeBarge Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
