It would always make me uncomfortable, but he would beg me to make YouTube videos because he was convinced that I would blow up, and I would always just say, 'Yeah right, girl.' I appreciated it, but I just didn't see what he saw in me, at the time."</p><h2 id=so-when-did-she-start---and-what-was-her-driver>So, When Did She Start - And What Was Her Driver?</h2><p>Jory might not have seen the magic in herself at the start of her journey as a content creator, but something motivated her to keep pushing, anyway.</p><p>So, what was it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I started making content in 2017, when I was struggling with gender dysphoria. I noticed a lack of diversity in the space of creators and models. I explored photography and modeling, hoping to get signed to an agency, and I used Instagram as a portfolio."</p><p>To an extent, that worked - two major modeling agencies came knocking.</p><p>However, they weren't without conditions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Exclusive: Jesse Sullivan Reveals The Moment He Decided To Share His Story With The World</a></span></p><p><strong>"They wanted me to close my stretched ears," </strong>Jory recounts.</p><p>Not willing to change herself, she refused - and she admits that for a time, she believed that was the end of the road for her.</p><p>"I still had gender dysphoria. I would never be a model, and the platform of 10k that I had built on Instagram was predominantly men, attracted to a version of me that didn't exist outside of their phone screen. I wasn't allowed to have opinions or thoughts, I was only allowed to post aesthetic photos and abs."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"So," </strong>she continues, <strong>"I quit my Instagram and made the jump to TikTok, to be free from the persona I'd developed."</strong></p><p>"I took with me the few bits of authenticity I had shown on that platform with me: being tattooed and wanting to build an inclusive space."</p><p>Sure enough, that authenticity resonated with her new audience -- and she began raking up the views.</p><p>"The day I decided to start posting regularly on TikTok, I hit around 300k views on a video where I was talking about being bisexual. I expected it to be a fluke, but the next day, I hit over 100k on a video - and it happened again, and again ... and again, day after day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Something tells us, this is still just the beginning of Jory's meteoric rise - and she's doing it all while staying true to herself.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Exclusive: HBO's Ari Rombough Is Here For Trans Representation Ahead Of Their 'The Last Of Us' Role</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmq6uZnqh6tbXKraaknaJit7C%2B2GamqZ2eqHq2vIyamaitpGLCtLXNoGStoJViva2t05%2Bmq6Vdqbxuv8eaqZ5lmJq%2FbsDRrpxmq5Whs3A%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-trans-tiktoker-jory-opens-up-about-using-the-platform-to-share-her-true-self.html&text=Trans%20TikToker%20Jory%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Using%20The%20Platform%20To%20Share%20Her%20True%20Self&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-trans-tiktoker-jory-opens-up-about-using-the-platform-to-share-her-true-self.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-trans-tiktoker-jory-opens-up-about-using-the-platform-to-share-her-true-self.html&title=Trans%20TikToker%20Jory%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Using%20The%20Platform%20To%20Share%20Her%20True%20Self" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fexclusive-trans-tiktoker-jory-opens-up-about-using-the-platform-to-share-her-true-self.html&title=Trans%20TikToker%20Jory%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Using%20The%20Platform%20To%20Share%20Her%20True%20Self" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-trans-tiktoker-jory-opens-up-about-using-the-platform-to-share-her-true-self.html&title=Trans%20TikToker%20Jory%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Using%20The%20Platform%20To%20Share%20Her%20True%20Self" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-trans-tiktoker-jory-opens-up-about-using-the-platform-to-share-her-true-self.html&description=Trans%20TikToker%20Jory%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Using%20The%20Platform%20To%20Share%20Her%20True%20Self" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./general-hospital-who-turned-in-sonny.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Turned in Sonny on General Hospital?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rachel-recchia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rachel Recchia Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriends, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
