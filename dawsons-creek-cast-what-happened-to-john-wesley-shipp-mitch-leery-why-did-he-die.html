But while the teenage characters are always dealing with drama and problems, the adult characters are beloved as well. Dawson's father, Mitch Leery, is a particularly important Dawson's Creek character. It's heartbreaking to watch Mitch and Gail deal with Gail's infidelity early on in the show. And it's even worse to remember that Mitch died while trying to grab some ice cream that fell by his feet while he was driving.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many fans are still shocked by this confusing death, John Wesley Shipp did a great job portraying this character. While Mitch didn't always understand his son, Mitch did his best to support and love Dawson, and his death affected Dawson terribly.

He played Blanchard Lovelace on One Life To Live and in 2010, he came back to that show and played the character of Eddie Ford.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie was murdered</a>, which is definitely a dramatic storyline: according to TV Guide, Matthew Buchanan killed Eddie Ford. Two of John Wesley Shipp's most popular and famous characters have been killed in extreme ways as Eddie was murdered and Mitch died in a car accident that was definitely unique.</p><p>In an interview with Soaps.sheknows.com, John Wesley Shipp said that it was amazing coming back to soap operas as he remembered being young and working in the genre in New York City.</p><p>The actor shared that he liked knowing that his character wouldn't be on the show for very long as this gave him a chance to be really creative. He liked it because he didn't need to be a "likable" character. John Wesley Shipp explained, "It was a limited contract, which was attractive to me. On a limited deal you can push the envelope. You don’t have to worry about surviving likability when the character offends fans."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Dawson's Creek': This Is What Kerr Smith Looks Like Now</a></span></p><h2 id=john-wesley-shipp-also-starred-on-39-the-flash-39>John Wesley Shipp Also Starred On 'The Flash'</h2><p>John Wesley Shipp has also been busy playing the character of Henry Allen on The Flash.
