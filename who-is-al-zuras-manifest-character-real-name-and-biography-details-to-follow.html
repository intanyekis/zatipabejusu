In the show Manifest, however, it is one of the most important mysteries.</strong></p><p>Jeff Rake made the American supernatural drama TV show Manifest, which debuted on NBC on September 24, 2018. The show is about the people who were on a commercial airliner that went on a mission and didn’t come back for five and a half years. Everyone thought they were dead.</p><p>Some of the actors who appear on Manifest are Josh Dallas, Holly Taylor, Athena Karkanis, J. R. Ramirez, Luna Blaise, Matt Long, Jack Messina, and Parveen Kaur. For a long time, the show has been obsessed with the idea of “Al Zuras.” In this article, we’ll tell you everything you need to know about this character.</p><h2>What is Al Zuras? Real Name and Bio of Manifest Character</h2><p>In a season 2 episode of Manifest, it is said that during the five years that Flight 828 was missing, it might have gone back in time to the 16th century. This is when and where the character Al Zuras is introduced.</p><p>One of the most important things to figure out in the NBC show is where the plane is and who is on it. But Ben (Josh Dallas) and Michaela (Melissa Roxburgh) still don’t know where it is after five and a half years. Flight 828 went missing for no clear reason and then turned up years later.</p><p>Since then, some travelers have been determined to find out what happened and why they got these strange messages, called the Callings.</p><p>Ben TJ and Olive did some research and found out that Yusuv Al-Zuras and the other people on his ship died in a storm in the 1600s. According to what he wrote in his journal, Al-Zuras and his men saw a “silver dragon” flying above them.</p><p>Flight 828 was the “silver dragon,” the passengers said in a call they all got. This showed that Flight 828 and Al-ship Zuras’s were in the same place and time for at least a split second.</p><h2>Al Zuras Age And Mystery</h2><p>We think Al Zuras is from the past, but we don’t know his age yet. After the plane crash, everyone came back ten years later, but they didn’t remember where they had been because Al-Zuras couldn’t understand. For them, it was like no time had passed, just like for the passengers.</p><p>After they got back to the ship, the crew started having visions. Drawings in Al-journal Zuras’s showed that Saanvi was one of the people and events he saw, even though they had not met yet.</p><p>Even though Al-mystery Zura’s was important, Manifest gave up on it after season 2. TJ notices, though, that Al-death Zuras’s isn’t mentioned. She figures that it happened ten years after he came back.</p><h2>Is Al Zuras real or not? Explaining the characters, scenes, and plot</h2><p>After introducing the Al-Zuras theory in Season 2, the show dropped it. Season 4 could change that by using the end of Cal’s Manifest from Season 3 to make Yusuf Al-Zuras a real character.</p><p>In the story, Montego Air Flight 828, which is going from Jamaica to New York City, goes through a short period of rough weather.</p><p>When the plane landed at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, New York, the 191 passengers and crew found out from NSA deputy director Robert Vance that more than five and a half years had passed while they were in the air. During that time, they were thought to be dead.</p><p>As the passengers re-enter society and come to terms with the fact that their lives and the lives of their loved ones are not the same as they used to be, they have what are called “callings.” These “callings” are voices and visions that tell them what will happen in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiuoaddnsBurctmsa6qkah6rq3Nop2eq6RisKmt0ZqarZ2iYr%2BmrctmpZqllWKur7CMm6Con6KWvanFjJ2crZmZocBuwM5mnaiknKTEcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-al-zuras-manifest-character-real-name-and-biography-details-to-follow.html&text=Who%20Is%20Al%20Zuras%3f%20Manifest%20Character%20Real%20Name%20And%20Biography%20Details%20To%20Follow%20The%20Talks%20Today&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-al-zuras-manifest-character-real-name-and-biography-details-to-follow.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-al-zuras-manifest-character-real-name-and-biography-details-to-follow.html&title=Who%20Is%20Al%20Zuras%3f%20Manifest%20Character%20Real%20Name%20And%20Biography%20Details%20To%20Follow%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-al-zuras-manifest-character-real-name-and-biography-details-to-follow.html&title=Who%20Is%20Al%20Zuras%3f%20Manifest%20Character%20Real%20Name%20And%20Biography%20Details%20To%20Follow%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-al-zuras-manifest-character-real-name-and-biography-details-to-follow.html&title=Who%20Is%20Al%20Zuras%3f%20Manifest%20Character%20Real%20Name%20And%20Biography%20Details%20To%20Follow%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-al-zuras-manifest-character-real-name-and-biography-details-to-follow.html&description=Who%20Is%20Al%20Zuras%3f%20Manifest%20Character%20Real%20Name%20And%20Biography%20Details%20To%20Follow%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./30-interesting-facts-about-the-pyramids-of-egypt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="30 Interesting Facts About The Pyramids Of Egypt">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./reggie-wilkerson-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reggie Wilkerson Death: the Chelsea High School football team mourns, in Chelsea, MA">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
