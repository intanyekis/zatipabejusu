Whether they're ragging on their friends or family, practicing their material on their followers, or just being&nbsp;accidentally&nbsp;funny, celebrity tweets are sure to warrant a laugh or two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Former Bachelor Contestants Who Have The Strongest Social Media Game</a></span></p><p>With that said, there are levels to this! There are funny celebrities, then there are hilarious ones. This list is inspired by the celebs that just go the extra mile. Here are 10 hilarious celebrity tweets that we couldn't scroll by.</p><h2 id=ryan-reynolds>Ryan Reynolds</h2><p>Ryan Reynolds' Twitter account usually reflects his roles as a husband and father. Ryan's tweets about his family usually go viral, as did one of the many, many jokes he'd made about his daughter in 2015.</p><p>He wrote, "I'm teaching my daughter that the sun goes down each night because it's mad at her. Probably gonna write a book on parenting at some point." Okay, so no one would mistake Ryan for father of the year, but you have to admit that's pretty funny. Plus, anyone who's ever had a hand in raising a small child knows that you sometimes have to use reverse psychology on them. Totally harmless. But if not, there's always therapy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=conan-o-brien>Conan O'Brien</h2><p>Everyone knows someone who's&nbsp;ruined the day&nbsp;because of&nbsp;the&nbsp;smelly&nbsp;food they brought to the office. Even worse are those people who cook or heat the offensive smelling food in the office microwave.</p><p>When this happens, the office&nbsp;usually wants to&nbsp;lock the offending party in the community closet, but that, of course, would result in a visit to HR. Thankfully, Conan O'Brien once Tweeted a possible solution and&nbsp;entertaining&nbsp;new business venture at the same time. He tweeted, "Shark Tank idea: a microwave that will self-destruct if someone tries to cook fish."&nbsp;Harsh, yet necessary.</p><h2 id=t-pain>T-Pain</h2><p>Celebrities aren't just great entertainers, they're also deep thinkers, able to articulate concerns that we didn't even know we had. Take, for example, T-Pains tweet from November 2018 when he asked: "Ever wonder how many ghosts you've hit with your car?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The thought of ghoulish passersby, yelling and raising an angry fist at getting run over is hilarious. But it's also unsettling. Ghosts aren't supposed to be able to feel pain, but how can we really be sure? Plus, all ghosts aren't friendly, so we could end up being haunting, which doesn't sound fun at all.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson>Dwayne Johnson</h2><p>Despite Dwayne Johnson's intimidating wrestling persona, as "the Rock," he's actually a really funny, personable guy. And he's never funnier and more personable than when he's making fun of Kevin Hart, his friend and movie costar.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Kylie Jenner's 10 Best Tweets Of 2019</a></span></p><p>And in a&nbsp;tweet, disguised as a plea to get people to vote, Dwayne took the biggest jab at Kevin, to date. He wrote, "Get out and VOTE. Don't do it for me. Do it for our little ones. #vote." Straight forward enough, except the picture he attached was of him holding his child, who Kevin's face was photo-shopped on top of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anna-kendrick>Anna Kendrick</h2><p>"Oh God. I just realized I'm stuck with me my whole life," is what Anna Kendrick tweeted in May of 2015. While the tweet definitely warrants a chuckle, you can't help but relate to it as well.</p><p>Sure, everyone is supposed to love themselves. And we do for the most part. But sometimes dealing with our own stuff is exhausting. Anna Kendrick not only understands this, but she's able to express it in a way that makes us laugh. Thank God for her.</p><h2 id=adam-rippon>Adam Rippon</h2><p>Food delivery services like Uber Eats have made life a little more convenient (if not more expensive). But they could still benefit from improvements. Adam Rippon&nbsp;once proposed his deal version of an upgrade.&nbsp;He said,&nbsp;"Is there an Uber eats that gets you the food but also feeds it to you and asks you about your day?"</p><p>We could totally get on board with having some company while we eat, but the whole feeding thing is beyond extreme. Still very funny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gabourey-sidibe>Gabourey Sidibe</h2><p>Amazon's Alexa might be the virtual assistant tool everyone's raving about today. But before she came along, there was Siri, an Apple-integrated tool that quickly&nbsp;won over the masses.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Bizarre Jaden Smith Tweets That You Missed&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>Part of Siri's appeal&nbsp;came from her sometimes sassy responses to people asking genuine (and sometimes not so genuine) questions. However, actress Gabourey Sidibe was less than impressed when she asked Siri to find local nail salons, and Siri replied "good" because her nails were sharp. The actress responded with, "I'm tired of Siri and her slick a-- mouth. Sometimes I drop my phone on purpose."</p><h2 id=mindy-kaling>Mindy Kaling</h2><p>Mindy Kaling's Twitter account is an absolute goldmine for funny tweets. The actress is always&nbsp;finding the humor in life's most mundane events,&nbsp;as well also some of the&nbsp;most unbelievable ones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, Mindy recounted one of the crazier moments she's experienced while working out. She tweeted,&nbsp;"My group exercise instructor thought I was dying. She opened the door and yelled 'someone help her!'" Just imagine the horror of being so bad at working out that the instructor thinks your life is over. Oh well, Mindy will have a funny story to tell her grand kids in the future.</p><h2 id=karamo-brown>Karamo Brown</h2><p>Trying to live a healthy life is hard, so it's natural that someone might try to find shortcuts now and again. That's exactly what Karamo Brown&nbsp;wondered about in&nbsp;2018. He asked,&nbsp;"Seeing my trainer in the morning and I'm wondering does the pack of @Starburst I just ate count as a serving of fresh fruit? #PleaseSayYes."</p><p>No,&nbsp;Starburst are not fruit. Sure, that should be common knowledge, but at least Karamo believes in the old adage: "there's no such thing as a dumb question."</p><h2 id=chrissy-teigen>Chrissy Teigen</h2><p>Chrissy Teigen is Twitter's unofficial queen, a title she's earned fair and square, which is why she had to take our number one spot!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chrissy's account&nbsp;is mostly made up jokes, recipes and debates with political figures, but in August 2014,&nbsp;Chrissy gave fans a glimpse of husband John Legend's future,&nbsp;should she meet an untimely demise. She said: "I always have a note in the back of my pocket that says "John did it," because I don't want him to remarry. #truelove #tips."&nbsp;Perhaps that response is a little crazy, but all's fair in love and war.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>KIM KARDASHIAN'S 10 BEST TWEETS OF 2019, RANKED</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nmJ65or7IqKysZZOauaau0aKrsmWkrLKmwNJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhilarious-celebrity-tweets.html&text=10%20Hilarious%20Celebrity%20Tweets%20We%20Couldn%27t%20Scroll%20Past&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhilarious-celebrity-tweets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhilarious-celebrity-tweets.html&title=10%20Hilarious%20Celebrity%20Tweets%20We%20Couldn%27t%20Scroll%20Past" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhilarious-celebrity-tweets.html&title=10%20Hilarious%20Celebrity%20Tweets%20We%20Couldn%27t%20Scroll%20Past" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhilarious-celebrity-tweets.html&title=10%20Hilarious%20Celebrity%20Tweets%20We%20Couldn%27t%20Scroll%20Past" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhilarious-celebrity-tweets.html&description=10%20Hilarious%20Celebrity%20Tweets%20We%20Couldn%27t%20Scroll%20Past" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./all-about-tina-ivlev-age-boyfriend-height-net-worth-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Tina Ivlev: Age, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Parents">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./morgan-wallen-ex-fiancee-katie-smith-violent-car-crash-face-injuries.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Morgan Wallen's Ex-Fiance In Violent Car Crash, Gnarly Facial Injur">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
