Hitchcock was already beginning to show such an obsession with these girls, as seen in the film The Lodger (1927). Perhaps it is because the beauty of these women that makes their names not go unnoticed in any corner of the world. But many times, their acting talent and great box-office hits are not enough to classify them as good actresses. Some of Hollywood's most famous and beloved blonde girls should not be performing, but rather modelling for the cameras or in the catwalks, as they are often highly questioned for their lack of acting skills. But if Alfred Hitchcock was obsessed with them, why not us too?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometime later, in the 90s, one of the most&nbsp;popular TV programs enjoyed by thousands of men and women was Baywatch. The series&nbsp;about lifeguards led by Mitch Buchannon is fundamental in the history of the small screen, and one of its indelible contributions is the long list of beautiful blonde women, most of them wearing that emblematic red one-piece swimsuit that made you think of only one thing: they've come to rescue me.</p><h2 id=pamela-anderson>Pamela Anderson</h2><p>This Canadian was the most famous blonde of the 90's. She was discovered during a football game in Vancouver. Then, she moved on to Playboy without stopping. In California, she played some minor roles&nbsp;on TV until 1992 when she joined the cast of Baywatch, where she stayed until 1998. Her character was C.J. Parker, who in addition to saving lives was interested in meditation and the prophecy of dreams. In any case, few remember that. The memory only has room to remember the opening of the program, with Pamela Anderson running along the beaches of California in that beautiful red one-piece swimsuit. Pam has had alleged love affairs with several celebrities including Dean Cain, Sylvester Stallone, Marcus Schenkenberg, Kelly Slater, Ben Affleck, Fred Durst and Eric Nies, and was married to Tommy Lee, Kid Rock and Rick Salomon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox>Megan Fox</h2><p>One of Hollywood's biggest femme fatale has been in many lousy movies. With the quality of these films it's difficult to determine if she can act or not. Fox achieved success in 2007 when she was selected to play Mikaela Banes co-starring with Shia LaBeouf in the film franchise Transformers, by director Michael Bay who had known her in 2003 as an extra on Bad Boys II. The film, with a budget of one hundred and fifty million dollars, reached more than seven hundred million and was a box office success, achieving worldwide recognition and fame. The truth is, Fox's just seems to be another pretty face. In 2007 she admitted being a fan of comics, anime, and video games, and her favorite artist is Michael Turner, author of the comic book Fathom, whom she claimed to be obsessed with for a long time. Maybe this helped her get the role of reporter April O'Neil in the two films about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mischa-barton>Mischa Barton</h2><p>The O.C. made her a starlet, but Hollywood isn't nice to all its stars. Mischa Barton's story is one of a hopeless downfall. The story of Barton is one of many in which a beautiful girl falls in love with the camera, but achieves success and fame too soon. The 11-year-old posed for Steven Meisel and soon after was the image of Calvin Klein's children's line. Her career in film and television took off almost at the same time. The Sixth Sense, several plays on Broadway and off-Broadway and finally, her role as Marissa Cooper in the iconic series The O.C., made her a big star. Unfortunately, in 2007, the actress began a never-ending struggle to solve her mental and substance addiction problems. And it seems that over time she is trying to get back her personal and professional life, but the road is full of thorns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez>Jennifer Lopez</h2><p>The case of this singer of Latin origin is special. Yes, she is not a platinum-haired blonde, but her constant style changes gives her a special place on this list. Everyone loves her and follows her, but not because of her skills as an actress, but because of her talent for singing. She played an acceptable role on Maid in Manhattan in 2002, but after this film she didn't have any outstanding performances, despite having filmed several more. After her breakup with Ben Affleck, Lopez began dating her old friend Marc Anthony, who would eventually become her husband in 2004. In 2007, on the last night of their tour, Lopez and Anthony officially confirmed that they were expecting their first child. But her love story ended in 2011, when the couple announced their divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-alba>Jessica Alba</h2><p>She began her television and film appearances at the age of 13 at Camp Nowhere and The Secret World of Alex Mack in 1994. Alba became famous as a lead actress in the Dark Angel series in 2000 until 2002. She then appeared in several films including Honey, Sin City, Fantastic Four, Into the Blue, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and Good Luck Chuck. Alba is (or was) very popular for her appearance, and still generates media attention for her company. The Honest Company. She was featured in Maxim's "Hot 100" section and was voted number one on AskMen.com's "99 Most Wanted Women" in 2006. From 2007 until today, Alba's appearance in cinema has been rather limited. Eventually, the beautiful woman decided to devote herself almost entirely to her life at home, with her husband and three children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-tisdale>Ashley Tisdale</h2><p>This sweet little girl (now 32) is known for her co-starring role as Sharpay Evans in Disney's High School Musical series. But also for her role as Madeline "Maddie" Fitzpatrick in the Disney series The Suite Life of Zack and Cody and for being the voice for Candace Flynn's character in the Disney Channel series Phineas and Ferb. She began her musical career at the beginning of 2007 with the release of Headstrong, and the album quickly made it to the top of the world charts, having sold 64,000 copies in its first week alone. Her second studio album, Guilty Pleasure, was released in July 2009. With a career that has been divided into musical albums, music tours, television and movies, Ashley Tisdale has unfortunately not experienced success as an artist, but rather for her sweetness and physical beauty.</p><h2 id=jenny-mccarthy>Jenny McCarthy</h2><p>After being admitted to Playboy, the magazine wanted her to pose for the October 1993 issue and she was paid $30,000 for the photo shoot. McCarthy became Playmate of the Month and then Playmate of the Year. In 1994, due to her popularity, Jenny moved to Los Angeles. There she hosted, for a time, the Playboy TV channel's Hot Rocks program. Subsequently, she began her career in television and film, although it has been rather limited. Interestingly, McCarthy did not participate in the TV series Baywatch, as she had everything to be one of their famous lifeguards. In 2004 she began writing a series of books on pregnancy and motherhood, motivated by the birth of her son Evan two years earlier. She is easily recognized for her role as Courtney in the series Two and a Half Men in which she "falls in love" with the character of Charlie Sheen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=erika-eleniak>Erika Eleniak</h2><p>At the age of 13, Eleniak appeared&nbsp;on E.T., which was a promising start for the young actress. Then, somewhere along the way she took a wrong turn, which&nbsp;left her attending AA meetings and&nbsp;on the pages of Playboy. Later, she'd make her appearance on Baywatch. Eleniak was in the initial three seasons, playing Shauni McClain, a rookie who suffered when people drowned and who also became paralyzed every time it was necessary to perform resuscitation maneuvers. Erika was the partner of actor Billy Warlock in 1989, then had an affair with William McNamara in 1994, but it was not until 1998 that she married nutritionist Philip Goglia, but their relationship ended a year later. Eleniak has a daughter named Indyanna, born in 2006, because of her relationship with model and singer Roch Daigle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tara-reid>Tara Reid</h2><p>Reid began performing at the age of 9, when she was on Child's Play, and appeared in more than 50 commercials, including Jell-O, McDonald's, Crayola and Milton Bradley. As a teenager, she was in Saved By The Bell: The New Class and All My Children. After moving to Hollywood in 1997, Reid made her film debut, getting a role in The Big Lebowski in 1998. She ended the year appearing in two other films: Cruel Intentions and Urban Legend. But it wasn't until 1999, with a minor role, when Reid played the character of the virginal Vickie in the movie American Pie. Because of her beauty and fame, Reid is not recognized as a talented actress, but as a very&nbsp;mediocre figure in Hollywood. Now she is mostly known for her party life and&nbsp;problems with alcohol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carmen-electra>Carmen Electra</h2><p>Tara Leigh Patrick, a.k.a. Carmen Electra wanted to be a Broadway dancer and that's the direction she focused her early career&nbsp;on. But she met Prince, and began a brief foray into the world of music until Playboy opened its doors to her. From there, her career shot up with her arrival in Baywatch, where she took over the role of Leilani McKenzie. Electra achieved considerable notoriety during her fleeting marriage to basketball star Dennis Rodman between 1998 and 1999. But later she had a brief&nbsp;relationship with&nbsp;Tommy Lee, Pamela Anderson's ex-husband, which led to a lot of tabloid coverage. In 2003, Electra married rocker Dave Navarro, but they split up in 2006.</p><h2 id=kristen-stewart>Kristen Stewart</h2><p>Just another case where beauty doesn't translate into talent. Kristen is beautiful, but quite boring and unconvincing on the screen. She has in her favor that she's still very young and her career is just beginning, so maybe she can correct the course. She became internationally famous for playing the role of Bella Swan in the Twilight saga. There, she maintained a relationship since 2009 with her co-actor, Robert Pattinson. For nearly four years, they did not explicitly confirm the relationship, but paparazzi photographs and eyewitness accounts led to intense media speculation, making them the focus of attention in the tabloids. In addition, since late 2016 Stewart has been romantically associated with Victoria's Secret's Belgian model, Stella Maxwell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-eggert>Nicole Eggert</h2><p>With&nbsp;an English mother and a German father, Eggert started out early in show business. At the age of 5, she was crowned Miss Universe Children, did shampoo commercials and in the 1980s was on Who's the Boss?, a series in which she was one of Alyssa Milano's friends. However, her big role on TV came in the 1990s, when she played Summer Quinn in Baywatch. Eggert was on the cast between 1992 and 1994, and there, Summer was a young woman who arrived in California escaping from her mother's violent boyfriend Jackie, who eventually pursued her to the sunny state. Eggert also played roles in various&nbsp;TV shows, like&nbsp;Fantasy Island, and participated in various&nbsp;B-list films during the 1990s and the first decade of the new millennium.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan>Lindsay Lohan</h2><p>Her career has had its lights and shadows. She is remembered for her&nbsp;role in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. However, as soon as she tasted fame, the problems began. First with drugs and alcohol and then with the law itself. In mid-2016, a video became&nbsp;viral around the world. It showed Lindsay Lohan being attacked by her boyfriend, Russian millionaire Egor Tarabasov. The material, filmed from a vehicle behind the van in which Lohan and Egor were travelling, showed a struggle in which her boyfriend physically attacked her to recover his cell phone. Now Lindsay is "at peace", according to her family and friends. The 31-year-old redhead (and most times blonde) got tired of being the center of the media scene and decided to move to Dubai. She assures us that there she has peace of mind because she goes "unnoticed".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gena-lee-nolin>Gena Lee Nolin</h2><p>Blonde Nolin made a name for herself on The Price is Right. But her best time was when she played Neely Capshaw, the character embodied by&nbsp;other actresses in the Baywatch series as well (Heather Campbell and Jennifer Campbell). She was the bad girl, but eventually she became the wife of Mitch Buchannon (David Hasselhoff), the Baywatch leader. Nolin was on the series between 1995 and 1998, and also appeared on the cover of magazines such as Maxim and Playboy. Shortly after the birth of her first child, Nolin was diagnosed and treated for postpartum depression, and then suffered from heart disorders during the third pregnancy. Like many other celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton, a home video of this woman was leaked on the Internet.</p><h2 id=donna-d-errico>Donna D’Errico</h2><p>D'Errico owned a limousine company in Las Vegas and posed for the Playboy magazine before landing a role on Baywatch. There, her role was Donna Marco between 1996 and 1998. She first showed up at Baywatch Nights, where she owned a nightclub, but then joined the lifeguards during the day. D'Errico described herself as a devout Catholic who attends church weekly and prays every night with her children. When asked how her renewed Catholic faith related to her past, she said, "I have made mistakes and choices in my past that I would not make today. It's a chapter in my life where I've closed the door. It's like I'm someone else. I am who I am today." She was married to hard rock band Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx between 1996 and 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6pLHLnpmsZaedvG6t0Z5kraCRo7inwculsGaZpKm%2Foq%2FToq2eZZKhvK%2BwxKxkrKGemLJuwMeesGabkaPBbq3CrWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-thankfully-attractive-blondes-since-they-cant-act.html&text=15%20Celebs%20In%20Hollywood%20Who%20Are%20Thankfully%20Attractive%20Blondes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-celebs-who-are-thankfully-attractive-blondes-since-they-cant-act.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-thankfully-attractive-blondes-since-they-cant-act.html&title=15%20Celebs%20In%20Hollywood%20Who%20Are%20Thankfully%20Attractive%20Blondes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-thankfully-attractive-blondes-since-they-cant-act.html&title=15%20Celebs%20In%20Hollywood%20Who%20Are%20Thankfully%20Attractive%20Blondes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-thankfully-attractive-blondes-since-they-cant-act.html&title=15%20Celebs%20In%20Hollywood%20Who%20Are%20Thankfully%20Attractive%20Blondes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-thankfully-attractive-blondes-since-they-cant-act.html&description=15%20Celebs%20In%20Hollywood%20Who%20Are%20Thankfully%20Attractive%20Blondes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./90-day-fiance-the-other-way-season-2-finale-who-stayed-together.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="90 Day Fiance: The Other Way Season 2 Finale: Who Stayed Together?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./this-is-us-recap-how-jacks-house-fire-began.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Is Us Recap: How Jacks House Fire Began">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
