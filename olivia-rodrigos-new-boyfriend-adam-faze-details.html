But what made her become the super star people know today was the release of her debut album entitled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sour</a>, where the song “Driver’s License” is included. “Driver’s License” is a breakup song that her fans assume to be about Olivia Rodrigo’s HSM:TMTS co-lead <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Bassett</a>.</p><p>Well, it appears that her nights of crying over her ex, whom she addressed as a traitor is over, which pleased Rodrigo’s fans. Not only that, but it looks like she has also moved on and found love once again this time with a man named Adam Faze.</p><p>Who is this new love interest of Olivia Rodrigo, and what are fans saying about him?</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Has Fame Affected Olivia Rodrigo's Mental Health?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=first-sighting-of-the-couple><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>First Sighting Of The Couple</span></h2><p>The couple was first seen together during the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Space Jam 2</a> premiere which was held at Six Flags Magic Mountain just north of Los Angeles.

It was said that the two met years ago after some common friends from the industry introduced them. They have been friends for quite some time, but it appears things have changed in their relationship to become much more romantic.</p><h2 id=who-is-adam-faze><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Who Is Adam Faze?</span></h2><p>Aside from being the new boyfriend of singer and actress Olivia Rodrigo, Adam Faze is a also producer. The 24-year-old currently resides in Los Angeles, California.

He is currently affiliated with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goody Grace</a> and has also produced the music video for his song that features <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">G-Eazy</a> entitled Girls in the Suburbs Singing Smiths Songs.</p><h2 id=he-is-a-former-writer-for-forbes-magazine><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Is A Former Writer For 'Forbes' Magazine</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Faze previously worked as a former media content contributor for Forbes</a> during his early 20’s in 2017.

Adam is the co-founder of Chateau Savant, an event series that launched this year during the Cannes Film Festival (May 18-26, 2017), and is represented by Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Ziffren Brittenham LLP.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Rodrigo Branded ‘Desperate’ After She Hosts A Prom For Fans</a></span></p><h2 id=faze-works-as-a-director-and-writer-for-television><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Faze Works As A Director And Writer For Television</span></h2><p>On Adam Faze’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> page, his resume adds director and writer along with his known producer profession. The majority of his projects happened in 2020 and 2021, writing for the popular TV series called Day by Day. Likewise, he also directed another music video of Goody Grace entitled Nothing Good, which features the collaboration of Goody Grace, Juicy J and G-Eazy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In partnership with Jamie Dolan, Faze established a production company, Must B Nice in March 2020. He even reflected on how he and Dolan started their company right when COVID-19 began, stating how they wondered about doing something about their current situation where their writers and actors are all at home, in quarantine. This gave birth to their narrative podcast entitled Day by Day, a bi-weekly show that aired April 17, 2020.</p><h2 id=adam-faze-olivia-rodrigo-and-their-social-media-privacy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Adam Faze, Olivia Rodrigo And Their Social Media Privacy</span></h2><p>Although Faze and Rodrigo’s sighting at Six Flags in June went viral, their relationship remains offline as of today. Faze has two Instagram accounts, and his personal account is private. However, his professional account @itsnotafaze is open to the public and is being followed by Rodrigo herself.</p><p>On the other hand, Olivia Rodrigo, on her account, has not yet posted anything regarding her relationship with Adam Faze.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-mind-the-gap><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Fans Mind The Gap</span></h2><p>What are fans saying about Olivia Rodrigo’s new love interest, Adam Faze? Well, for starters, they are not really in total support of the relationship, as the age gap between the couple is six years. As Olivia just turned 18 last February 2021, Faze is believed to be 24-years-old.</p><p>This was also the reason why fans went crazy on social media, especially on Twitter. When news broke about the movie event in California, where they were seen holding hands and being together the entire night. Olivia Rodrigo’s diehard followers expressed their thoughts on the social media platform, stating their dislike of the new couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it was not because Adam Faze is not worthy or might prove to be bad for Olivia, but mainly because of the age disparity between the two.</p><h2 id=was-he-dating-someone-just-before-olivia><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Was He Dating Someone Just Before Olivia?</span></h2><p>According to one Twitter user, Adam Faze might have actually been involved in another relationship just before getting together with the "Good 4 U" singer. And it would appear that he didn't end things amicably with the other girl, because she claims he totally ghosted her for Olivia, and it looks like she has the receipts to prove it.</p><p>However, fans of Olivia are coming to her defense stating she would not jump into another complicated relationship after just getting out of one.</p><p><span class=next-single><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney Love Calls Out Olivia Rodrigo For Copying Hole’s Album Concept</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimpaGmnq5uvs6dqaKfn6h6r7HWZpmosZantqa6w2aYnZmdYrOixsRmm56skZ65tHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2folivia-rodrigos-new-boyfriend-adam-faze-details.html&text=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20New%20Boyfriend%2c%20Who%20Is%20He%20And%20What%20Are%20Fans%20Saying%20About%20Him%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivia-rodrigos-new-boyfriend-adam-faze-details.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivia-rodrigos-new-boyfriend-adam-faze-details.html&title=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20New%20Boyfriend%2c%20Who%20Is%20He%20And%20What%20Are%20Fans%20Saying%20About%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2folivia-rodrigos-new-boyfriend-adam-faze-details.html&title=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20New%20Boyfriend%2c%20Who%20Is%20He%20And%20What%20Are%20Fans%20Saying%20About%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2folivia-rodrigos-new-boyfriend-adam-faze-details.html&title=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20New%20Boyfriend%2c%20Who%20Is%20He%20And%20What%20Are%20Fans%20Saying%20About%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivia-rodrigos-new-boyfriend-adam-faze-details.html&description=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20New%20Boyfriend%2c%20Who%20Is%20He%20And%20What%20Are%20Fans%20Saying%20About%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sofia-vergara-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sofia Vergara Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./memphis-rapper-casino-jizzle-was-shot-to-death-in-the-driveway-what-actually-happened-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Memphis Rapper Casino Jizzle was Shot to Death in the Driveway, What Actually Happened?
