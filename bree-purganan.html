As of now, Jalen plays for the <i>Houston Rockets</i> in NBA. Like her son, she also has a profession of her own as a nurse and an entrepreneur.</p><p>Purganan's&nbsp;son, Jalen Green, is a 6 feet 4 inches (<strong>193cm</strong>) tall basketball player who became the third player in the NBA of Filipino. Before him, Jordan Clarkson & Raymond Townsend holds the first and second list.</p><h2>Short Bio Of Jalen Green's Mother</h2><p>Standing at the height of 5 feet 5 inches (165cm), Bree Purganan grew up in Ilocos Sur, Philippines. She seems to have been born between the late 80s and early 90s. However, her exact date of birth has not been revealed yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/26/Bree%20Purganan%20fjas%5D-1672037978780.jpg><p>Regarding Purganan parents, she has only revealed her mother's identity. Julia Durbin is her mother, who worked as a teacher, but her father's identity remains a mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>Reportedly, Bree has two siblings: Kriste Canon and John Bass. As of now, Purganan works as a nurse and is also an entrepreneur. However, any knowledge about her business hasn't been made public yet.</p><h2>Relationship Timeline & Marriage Details&nbsp;</h2><p>Jalen Green's mother, Bree Purganan, is married to Marcus Green, a former basketball player. Her husband is the one who encouraged Jalen to play basketball. This romantic couple supported Jalen from the beginning of his career.</p><p>Bree's husband, Marcus, also happens to be the teammate of a well-known NBA player, DeShawn Steveson. They played together at Washington Union High School.&nbsp;</p><h3>Who Is Bree Purganan First Husband?</h3><p>Yes, Marcus Green was not the first husband of Bree Purganan. Instead, he is the second and current husband of Bree. It is because she was previously married to another person whose identity is still behind the curtains.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Jalen Green is not the biological son of Marcus. It is because he was born when Bree was with her first husband. More importantly, Marcus raised Jalen like his son, giving him his last name.</p><h2>Bree Has Other Children Besides Jalen</h2><p>Bree Purganan is the mother of three children, just like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Erin Burnett</a>. Jalen Green&nbsp;is Bree's second child because her first and oldest child in the family is<strong> Raquel Purganan</strong>. As of now, Raquel is currently in a married relationship with <strong>Steve Tucker</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/26/Jalen-Green-With-Family-1672038077801.jpg><p>Bree's third and last child is Jurnee Tyra. Being the youngest, she enjoys many privileges and is loved by everyone.</p><h2>What Is Bree Purganan's Net Worth?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Purganan has not disclosed her net worth to the public like <a href=#><strong>Katie Morton</strong></a><strong>.</strong> However, considering she has a career and income source of her own, she doesn't need to rely on her famous son for financial support.</p><p>As for her son, Jalen Green, he signed a<strong> $500,000</strong> contract for a year in the G-League. As per <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Spotrac</i></a>, he then signed a four-year contract of around $40 million with the Houston Rockets. The contract grants him a base salary of $8.9 million for 2021-22, which will only increase in the next four years.</p><p>So, it's safe to say that Jalen's net worth is multi-millions based on his salary and earnings. Also, check out the net worth of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bill Burr</a>.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Bree doesn't seem to be an active user of social media platforms. As such, she doesn't have any social media accounts. In contrast, her son Jalen Green has a verified account on various social media platforms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/26/31acc86c84ec423a-1672038204010.jpg><p>Jalen has over <strong>2.4 million</strong> followers on his Instagram account <a href=# rel=nofollow>@jalen</a>. With such a massive following, he gets hundreds of thousands of likes on every post. He also has a Twitter account with the handle <a href=# rel=nofollow>@JalenGreen</a>, which has over 197.6k followers. He is active on Twitter but only tweets a few times per month.</p><p>Similarly, Jalen&nbsp;has a Facebook account, <a href=# rel=nofollow>@Jalen-Green</a>, with over <strong>506k</strong> followers. However, it doesn't look like he is active over there. He posted his last video on September 22, 2020.</p><h2>Is Jalen Green In A Relationship?</h2><p>Purganan's son Jalen is currently dating a model, Breah Hicks. They first made their relationship public in June 2021 and have been together for over a year and a half.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/26/E4nLGdNWYAIbAc9-1672038378131.jpg><p>Breah stood beside Jalen at the NBA Draft 2021, the month after Jalen and Breah announced their relationship. At that time, he got selected by the Houston Rockets. Since that day, they have maintained a close relationship with each other.</p><h3>Jalen Is Not The Only Star Breah Hicks Dated</h3><p>Jalen Green's current girlfriend, Breah Hicks, previously dated Christian Combs for over six years. He is the son of the famous rapper and entrepreneur P. Diddy or Sean Combs.</p><p>Breah and Combs began dating each other when they were still in high school. While she went to Notre Dame High School, Christian attended Sierra Canyon High School, but they were only around 20 minutes apart.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ex-couple Breah and Christian broke up with each other on April 2021. Reportedly, it was caused by lies, unfaithfulness, and a lack of growth.</p><h2>A Little About Jalen Green</h2><p>Jalen Green, or Jalen Romande Green, was born on February 9, 2022, in Merced, California. He is a professional NBA player of Filipino descent, making him third in the line behind Raymond Townsend and Jordan Clarkson.</p><p>Jalen was already been playing basketball since sixth grade. Back then, he played for <i>Amateur Athletic Union</i> and practiced at least five hours daily. This proves that working hard will be fruitful.</p><h2>Jalen Helped Win The Championship When He Was In High School</h2><p>Jalen played for San Joaquin Memorial High School in his three high school years. When he was just in his junior year, he led the team to the California Interscholastic Federation's Division II quarterfinals.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Jalen led his team to win the <i>CIF Division II</i> title in his second year. Similarly, he got the second <i>CIF Division II</i> title consecutively. After that, he was transferred to Prolific Prep, where he led the team to win the <i>Grind Session World Championship</i>. He was named the Grind Session's most valuable player along with Daishen Nix in 2020.</p><h3>Bree Purganan Son Jalen Green Has Three Gold Medals Under His Belt</h3><p>Jalen plays for the US internationally, making his debut on the world stage at <i>FIBA Under-16 Americas Championship</i> in 2017. There he got his first gold medal with his team.</p><p>In the 2018 <i>FIBA Under -17 Basketball World Cup</i>, he was awarded the MVP in the tournament, winning his second gold medal.
