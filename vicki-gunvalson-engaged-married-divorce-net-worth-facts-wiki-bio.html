Her controversial relationship with her ex-boyfriend, <strong>Brooks Ayers</strong>, is the reason now that she is finding her name in the headlines of many media outlets.</p><p>For many people, divorce brings lots of difficulties but for Vicki, it seems to provide her with an opportunity to find another man to fall in love with. Despite having so many ups and downs in her love life, she still managed to find <strong>Steve Lodge</strong>, with whom she is living a joyous life at present.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Vicki_Gunvalson></span>Who is Vicki Gunvalson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vicki Gunvalson</a> is an American reality television personality, famous her starring role as a housewife in the Bravo reality television series, The Real Housewives of Orange Country. She also played in several other series and short movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Vicki-Gunvalson-is-an-American-reality-television-personality..jpg><p>Gunvalson was born on March 27, 1962, in a middle-class family in Chicago, Illinois, the United States of America, to parents of American descent. She has four siblings, <strong>Kathy Moloney</strong>, <strong>Lisa Bussenger</strong>, <strong>Kim Steinmetz</strong> and <strong>William Steinmetz</strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Vicky_Gunvalson%E2%80%99s_Personal_Life_Is_She_Engaged_To_Someone></span>Vicky Gunvalson’s Personal Life: Is She Engaged To Someone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vicky Gunvalson is engaged to Steve Lodge, brother of <strong>Roger Lodge</strong>, who is an American Game Show host. The duo has been together for three years. She confirmed her engagement to Steve last week. She said:</p><p><strong>We’re so happy. He’s an amazing guy and the proposal was perfect. I can’t wait.</strong></p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsb85jCheI6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><p>Vicki and Steve seem to be enjoying their time together and may be ready to take the wedding vow pretty soon. In this photo shared by Vicki, the couple is enjoying wine in cups which were gifted to them by Vicky’s children, <strong>Briana Culberson,</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Wolfsmith</strong>.</p><h3>Vicki Gunvalson’s Past Relationship: Was She Married To Someone?</h3><p>Mother of two children, Vicki Gunvalson has been married two times. She was first married to husband <strong>Michael J. Wolfsmith</strong> when she was just 21 years of age. They tied a knot in 1981, but eventually got a divorce in 1991. The duo shared two children between them before the split, Briana and Michael. Their relationship is, however, rumored to be Vicki’s desperate attempt to stay in the show, The Real Housewives of Orange Country.</p><p>Shortly after her divorce with Michael, she walked down the aisle with <strong>Donn Gunvalson</strong> in&nbsp;1994. However, their relationship did not work out well and&nbsp;they got a divorce in 2014. She also established Coto Insurance and Financial Services, shortly after she reacquired her insurance license in California with Donn.</p><h3>Vicki Gunvalson’s Relationship With Her Ex-Boyfriend: How Was It?</h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vicki Gunvalson was in a romantic relationship with her boyfriend, Brooks Ayers</a>, an American businessperson, after her divorce with Donn. The duo met during an insurance and investment conference in Atlanta in May 2007.

This is because the couple had a bittersweet relationship. Their relationship went smoothly during the beginning then came the twists and turns and downfall in their relation.</p><p>Vicki’s ex-partner, Brooks confessed to faking the cancer diagnosis by saying that he purposely fixed all the chemo bills trying to prove that he has cancer. Vicki was unaware of Brooks’ lies and she says that she made a wrong choice by falling in love with Ayers.</p><p>Victoria has served her ex-boyfriend with a lawsuit over the <strong>$266,000</strong> he allegedly owes her. She has hired a process server who successfully served her controversial ex-boyfriend. Gunvalson claims to have started loaning him money in 2011 after they began dating. Moreover, she said Ayers still owed her <strong>$184,899</strong>&nbsp;and another&nbsp;<strong>$81,652.97</strong>&nbsp;for attorney fees she paid for him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Vicky_Gunvalson%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth_How_Much_Does_She_Earn></span>Vicky Gunvalson’s Net Worth: How Much Does She Earn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vicky Gunvalson possesses an estimated net worth of&nbsp;<strong>$8 million</strong>, whereas her ex-boyfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooks Ayers owns an estimated net worth of <strong>$150 thousand</strong></a>.
