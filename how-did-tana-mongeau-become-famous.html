Dubbed the queen of controversy, the YouTube star has definitely earned her crown in the eyes of her fans, who have become <a href=#>hooked on her famous 'storytimes'</a> since her rise to fame.</p><p>However, it's not only VLOG style content that has become popular on YouTube, many other successful faces have adventured into the lands of gaming, cooking, the creation of documentaries, and even into the realms of online podcasts, an area that has seen a particular boom over the last two years.</p><p>Even Tana has begun to explore this fairly new realm over the last twelve months, however, just how did she become as famous as she is today?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="How Much Money Does Tana Mongeau Make Per Sponsored Post?">How Much Money Does Tana Mongeau Make Per Sponsored Post?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tana-mongeau-had-a-chaotic-childhood>Tana Mongeau Had A Chaotic Childhood</h2><p>Popular American YouTube personality Tana Mongeau was born in Las Vegas in the year of 1998, making her 23 years old. Considering her young age, she has already achieved an incredible amount that many people dream of. However, considering her upbringing, it wasn't always all roses and flowers for the star, who now currently resides in LA.</p><p>Over the course of her career, Mongeau has opened up several times about some chaotic moments from her younger years. Many of these stories are focused on the relationship between her and her father, as well as echoing similar sentiments about her mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her parents have been noticeably absent for much of her career, and despite the YouTuber mentioning her relationship with her parents improved, she also stated in a video that 'in so many ways she still wants nothing to do with them'. She has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recalled other stories where her father would do bizarre things</a>, how the relationship between her mother and father was also particularly abnormal, and that the pair are basically unfit to be parents.</p><p>Even years later after Mongeau escaped her parents' house, her rocky relationship with the two still affects her now. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">star claims she felt as though she was 'raising herself'</a> throughout her childhood, as her parents were never able to do it properly.</p><p>Growing up in Las Vegas Mongeau had also been regularly exposed to drugs, parties, and alcohol from a very young age.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="TikToker Josh Richards Thinks Tana Mongeau Is The Best Clout Chaser">TikToker Josh Richards Thinks Tana Mongeau Is The Best Clout Chaser</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=so-how-did-tana-mongeau-become-famous>So How Did Tana Mongeau Become Famous?</h2><p>As an escape from the build-up of mental and emotional abuse she received at home from her parents, Tana <a href=#>channeled her sorrows into creating 'story time' videos</a> to share online. She launched her channel in 2015. In a way, this was her therapeutic remedy. Whilst Tana expected nothing of her small venture at first, she was quickly met with surprise as she watched more and more people tune in to watch her videos every week.</p><p>Soon after she found herself with a million subscribers, an impressive feat considering she had only launched her channel less than a year prior. The momentum continued in the following years, with the YouTuber reaching over 5 million subscribers in 2019. In just four years, she'd come a long way from posting her first storytime in her Las Vegas bedroom.</p><p>Many of her past videos during her rise to stardom have involved collaborating with other well-known YouTubers in the space, such as Shane Dawson, James Charles, and David Dobrik. However, the star has formed and broken many friendships during her time on the platform, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allegedly no longer being friends</a> with beauty guru James Charles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her largely popular storytime videos, she also <a href=#>spills the tea on dramas she experiences</a> in her closer and more personal friendship circle. This is the content that many of her fans live for.</p><p>In addition to her classic storytime videos, Tana also received a popularity boost for her public relationship with actress Bella Thorne, whom she started dating in 2017. Many of her other controversies, such as TanaCon and feuds with other YouTubers burned the spotlight even brighter upon her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title='Tana Mongeau Refuses To Date "Internet F-Boys"'>Tana Mongeau Refuses To Date "Internet F-Boys"</a></span></p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-in-tana-39-s-career>What's Next In Tana's Career</h2><p>Due to Tana's bubbly, outspoken and outgoing personality, it's not hard to see why many of her fans adore her so much. However, now she has achieved such great feats in terms of her YouTube career, many have been left wondering what will be next in line for Tana's career. Luckily, we've already had a short preview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During 2021, Mongeau launched her highly anticipated new podcast 'Canceled', which has received lots of positive feedback from fans. The podcast includes an array of different guests, where conversations are completely raw and unfiltered, in classic Tana style. The podcast looks to set Tana on a more stable and steady career path, with swathes of fans regularly returning for more on a weekly basis. Whilst much of the podcast is available on YouTube, fans can also tune in via Apple Podcasts.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# title="Noah Cyrus And Tana Mongeau Confirm They're Girlfriends Again With New Raunchy Pics">Noah Cyrus And Tana Mongeau Confirm They're Girlfriends Again With New Raunchy Pics</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledOapZplnaS7qLHArmSbnZOkuqZ5xZqkqK2jZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-tana-mongeau-become-famous.html&text=How%20Did%20Tana%20Mongeau%20Become%20Famous%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-tana-mongeau-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-tana-mongeau-become-famous.html&title=How%20Did%20Tana%20Mongeau%20Become%20Famous%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-did-tana-mongeau-become-famous.html&title=How%20Did%20Tana%20Mongeau%20Become%20Famous%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-tana-mongeau-become-famous.html&title=How%20Did%20Tana%20Mongeau%20Become%20Famous%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-tana-mongeau-become-famous.html&description=How%20Did%20Tana%20Mongeau%20Become%20Famous%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lions-predictions-nfl-midseason.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lions predictions at NFL midseason: Detroit wins the NFC North  and a playoff game">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gothamchess-shocking-net-worth-revealed-is-levy-rozman-is-a-millionaire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="GothamChess Shocking Net Worth Revealed- Is Levy Rozman Is A Millionaire?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
