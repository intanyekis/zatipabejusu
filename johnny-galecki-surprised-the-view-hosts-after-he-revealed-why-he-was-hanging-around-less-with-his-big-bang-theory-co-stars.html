Ultimately, Galecki received strong support from fans for his interview conduct.</p><p>We'll take a look at how Galecki handled a question about his sexuality.

Galecki was all smiles during the interview. He even had a unique answer to if he saw his Big Bang Theory co-stars frequently off-camera.

Goldberg asked Galecki about the rumors related to his sexuality.</p><p>The host asks, "Now that we know you're not gay, can you tell us if you have a girlfriend? I can't even believe this question was one here. I should've looked at it before I said it."</p><p>Whoopi would go on to apologize for the question, while Johnny had the perfect response.

"Right now, as far as the higher gun actor stuff I want to kind of take a break and let it run its course through my blood stream." Galecki continues, "I say that, but something always comes up."</p><p>Given his crazy schedule on The Big Bang Theory for 12 seasons, it is understandable that Galecki wanted to take time off. He was also ready for TBBT to end, but didn't like the way it all came about.</p><p>"I was shocked. We were just blindsided that day. And not necessarily shocked by Jim's decision, but that he hadn't had that conversation with his castmates first to prepare us."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Galecki continues, "I stopped myself from doing so and I hugged [Jim] instead.
