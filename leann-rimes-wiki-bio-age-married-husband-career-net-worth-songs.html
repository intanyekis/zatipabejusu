A person in love is blind to the rest of the world and can face any obstacle for their union. But it’s hard to differentiate between love and attraction which can cause many heartbreaks and ruin lives.</p><p>No one can judge what is love and what isn’t which makes it harder for people to recognize it. It makes people take drastic steps and measures beyond one can comprehend.&nbsp;<strong>LeAnn Rimes</strong> is a well-known Country singer who also seems to have made the mistake in understanding it. But she also took big decisions to later pursue it when she finally found it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=LeAnn_Rimes%E2%80%99_Married_Life_and_Husband></span>LeAnn Rimes’ Married Life and Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At Present, LeAnn Rimes and <strong>Eddie Cibrian</strong> are in a married relationship.

He was a backup dancer whom she met while hosting the 2001&nbsp;Academy of Country Music Awards. The two fell in love and walked down the aisle the following year.</p><p>Rimes told&nbsp;<i>InStyle Magazine </i>that she wanted to marry him after her first date and they married in 2002. But they parted ways in July 2009 and announced their divorce in September 2009.</p><p>The divorce was finalized on June 19, 2010, exactly six months after Sheremet filed the divorce documents for dissolution of marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LeAnn-with-Dean.gif><p>The marriage had ended because of her extramarital&nbsp;affair&nbsp;with Eddie Cibrian&nbsp;while she worked with him on&nbsp;<i>Northern Lights.</i>&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandi Glanville</a></strong>, Cibrian’s ex-wife also filed for divorce as a result of the adultery in August 2009. This ended their eight years of marriage.</p><p>In June 2010, Rimes talked about the end of her first marriage stating;</p><p><strong>“I take responsibility for everything I’ve done. I hate that people got hurt, but I don’t regret the outcome.”</strong></p><p>On December 27, 2010, it was announced via&nbsp;<i>Billboard</i>&nbsp;that Rimes and Cibrian engaged.&nbsp;Rimes and Cibrian wed on April 22, 2011, at a private home in California, in front of a few friends and family members.</p><p>After that, her profession has frequently been eclipsed by the open disputes between them and Cibrian’s ex-wife, Brandi Glanville.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=New_Tattoo_Controversy></span>New Tattoo Controversy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Recently, a photo posted by LeAnn Rimes on her social media shows a new tattoo on her hand that reads, “god’s work.” Due to the use of a small alphabet, LeAnn is now surrounded by controversy.</p><p>While many fans found the design awesome, a ton of others criticized it.

She alleged that they defrauded her of <strong>$7 million</strong> in five years.</p><p>They actually defrauded her of&nbsp;<strong>$8 million</strong> and not <strong>$7 million</strong> after proper&nbsp;investigations.
