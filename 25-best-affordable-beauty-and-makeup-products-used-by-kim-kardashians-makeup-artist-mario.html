Most people credit her for bringing contouring makeup into style, but that almost certainly wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the work of her long time makeup artist, Mario Dedivanovic. Dedivanovic's work on Kim has become so ubiquitous and admired that he even teaches his own makeup master classes so that anyone can learn to deck themselves out Kardashian style, and he can charge a few hundred to upwards of a thousand dollars for that privilege. And obviously it takes a lot of effort, talent, and skill development to get to his level, but that doesn't mean that regular people can't use his tips, tricks, and favorite products to take their makeup looks up a few notches.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While his celebrity clients almost certainly wear the highest of high-end makeup products when they appear on red carpets or at specific events, that doesn't mean that there aren't a few shockingly inexpensive and normal makeup products in Mario's beauty arsenal. So what beauty products can you add to your collection that won't break your bank, but will ensure that you look as fabulous and flawless as possible? And which super affordable products work well enough that even someone with an unlimited beauty budget would choose them to complete their beauty looks? Read on to find out which normal products can give you extraordinary, red carpet-worthy results!</p><h2 id=neutrogena-makeup-removing-cleanser-towelettes-6-99>Neutrogena Makeup Removing Cleanser Towelettes $6.99</h2><p>These little makeup remover wipes are certainly oldies but goodies, and there's a reason they've been such a stand-by in the makeup world for so long. Obviously, they're relatively inexpensive, they're from skin care empire Neutrogena so you know you won't be rubbing any harsh chemicals into your face, and most importantly, they actually effectively remove your makeup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>You always want to ensure that your pores are clean and clear, and when you're wearing as much makeup as Kim Kardashian is on the regular you want to make sure that you get everything off after a long day of wear, but also make sure that you're treating your skin well in the process.</strong></p><p>After all, your skin is really the foundation of any makeup look, and no matter how much you're putting on top of it if you're having skin problems then it will unfortunately show through your look no matter what.</p><h2 id=olly-vitamins-14>Olly Vitamins $14</h2><p>The old adage "beauty comes from within" is certainly a precept to live by, and if you want to think of it a little more literally then this particular beauty secret should make a whole lot of sense. Vitamins certainly help to keep you healthy, but they are also a pretty key ingredient in keeping your outsides looking as refreshed and dewy as your insides. And obviously any vitamins will help keep you staying and looking good, but Mario's particular faves are Olly vitamins, which isn't much of a surprise. The gummy vitamins are relatively inexpensive, taste great, and come in a whole bunch of different formulations designed to fit your specific needs. Of course they have the basic multivitamins for men, women, and children, but they also have products specifically designed to help you get what you want out of a vitamin boost, whether that's a better immune system, more energy, or yes, even to make you look prettier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anastasia-beverly-hills-brow-wiz-21>Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz $21</h2><p>Shelling out over twenty bucks for a brow product might seem like it's a bit much, but considering that a good brow can make or break your makeup look and considering that Anastasia Beverly Hills is considered the foremost expert in fabulous brow looks, investing in an Anastasia Brow Wiz might be worth it for you.</p><p><strong>Obviously a strong brow is an essential part of nailing a classic Kim Kardashian makeup look, and what's great about the Anastasia Brow Wiz is that it's an all-in-one brow product that helps you create a realistic filled-in brow.</strong></p><p>The shade range that they offer ensures that you'll be able to find a great match for your natural brows. And Anastasia Soare, the creator of Anastasia Beverly Hills, does Kim Kardashian's eyebrows herself, so if you want to perfect your Kim Kardashian brow without having to see the brow guru herself then snagging a Brow Wiz is probably your best chance at doing it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anastasia-beverly-hills-modern-renaissance-eyeshadow-palette-42>Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance Eyeshadow Palette $42</h2><p>On its face, this eye shadow palette might seem like it costs a pretty penny, but this super popular makeup favorite features 14 different eye shadow colors that are super high quality and easy to work with for a less experienced makeup hand. This palette leans heavily towards the warm tones, but if you like a warm eye look then you'll have hundreds of makeup options from this single palette, and the shadows are both easy to blend out and super highly pigmented, which makes it way easier to get a great look without a lot of time, effort, or skill required.</p><p><strong>Anastasia makes some of the most popular and reasonably priced high-end eye shadow palettes, and the Modern Renaissance palette is probably one of their most popular and beloved products.</strong></p><p>So if you're looking for an eye shadow set that is quick and easy to use and offers you a variety of looks then this palette is definitely worth your consideration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-arden-8-hour-cream-22>Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Cream $22</h2><p>Sometimes you can find products that offer you drugstore prices with high-end value, and sometimes you can find high-end products that offer you high-end results but still have drugstore (or at least near drugstore) prices. The Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Cream is one of those high-end products that works really well but won't break your bank either. In order to have a great makeup look you need to have healthy, hydrated skin beneath all of that makeup, and finding a moisturizer that will keep you dewy and fresh for the entire day is super important. A lot of makeup products can suck the life out of your skin, so creating a solid barrier between your skin and the products that might damage it is an essential aspect of consistently looking good. This moisturizer moisturizes, but will also do a fair amount of heavy lifting for your makeup to make sure you're looking great all day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beauty-blender-20>Beauty Blender $20</h2><p>When it comes to a beauty sponge makeup applicator, the beauty blender might seem like one of the pricier options at first glance, but this reusable sponge is called the original beauty blender for a reason. These washable sponges can give your makeup an airbrushed, flawless finish even if you don't have a lot of time to be working on your look or don't have a lot of makeup application skills quite yet. The beauty blender usually works best after you dampen the sponge and use the soft and fluffed up sponge to bounce your foundation all over your skin, and it has a pointed end that you can use for more precise applications in specific areas of the face. If $20 still seems like too much there are plenty of drugstore dupes that are in a lower price range (the Real Techniques and L'Oreal sponges are fan favorites), but the reason so many copies exist in the first place is because the beauty blender is just that good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beauty-360-jumbo-cosmetic-wedges-5>Beauty 360 Jumbo Cosmetic Wedges $5</h2><p>If a $20 dollar beauty blender is outside of your desired price range for a makeup sponge then don't fret, there are still some really fantastic and ultra cheap options to help you get a beautiful application of makeup with a sponge. Mario Dedivanovic prefers these beauty sponges that you can find at your local CVS. The Beauty 360 brand is actually the beauty line made specifically for CVS, and although you might get generic prices on their products you're not going to get generic value.</p><p><strong>Like a beauty blender, you can use these sponges dry or damp, and they're great to apply your foundation, powder, or nearly any other makeup product you can think of.</strong></p><p>Plus for a measly five dollars you can get a pack of 30 sponges, so even if you wanted to use a sponge a day and then toss them you'd only be shelling out five dollars a month to keep looking fab.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laura-mercier-velour-powder-puff-15>Laura Mercier Velour Powder Puff $15</h2><p>When you spend ages trying to perfect your makeup, there's really nothing worse than having that makeup fade, smudge, or generally become a hot mess, which is why you always want to be sure to set your makeup with a powder and some setting spray. There are plenty of different ways to powder your face after your makeup is complete, but one of the best ways to apply your translucent setting powder is with a classic powder puff. Kim Kardashian's makeup artist swears by the Laura Mercier velour powder puff, so much so that it's become kind his own icon that people associate with him. He says that it's one of the easiest way to press powder into your makeup to create a seamless blend and flawless finish, and that it's really the most effective way of giving yourself a polished, powdered look without actually making your face look dry and overly powdery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=colgate-toothpaste-4-99>Colgate Toothpaste $4.99</h2><p>Most people wouldn't consider toothpaste to be an essential beauty product, but having a nice, bright smile is one of the simplest and easiest beauty tricks to complete a polished look, and can also be one of the easiest things to overlook when you're in a rush. That's why Mario says he likes to carry a tube of Colgate toothpaste in his makeup kit at all times, because if one of his clients wants to do a quick tooth touch up during their makeup session it's good to have some Colgate on hand. Everyone knows that they should be brushing their teeth every morning and every night to maintain good dental health, but it's also good to keep in mind that giving your teeth a good scrub before an event or before going out for the night will ensure that you're looking good and super polished from head to toe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=essence-of-beauty-wedges-4>Essence of Beauty Wedges $4</h2><p>If you're looking for some makeup products and tools that give you a whole lot of bang for your buck then Essence of Beauty brand makeup products are definitely worth a look. They offer a wide range of products for nearly every aspect of your beauty routine that are crazy inexpensive, so if you're in the market for some new products then you can give essence a try without worrying about wasting too much money on a new product that might not work for you.</p><p><strong>These particular makeup sponges are great for big or small makeup applications, and the beefy sponges with sharp edges are good for packing on your foundation or applying products that require a finer touch.</strong></p><p>And these sponge packs are inexpensive enough that you don't have to worry about germs or cleanliness. Honestly, you can dispose of a sponge after one use if you want and you still won't have wasted too much cash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=l-oreal-voluminous-mascara-7-29>L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara $7.29</h2><p>Usually if a product becomes an old standby it's for a very good reason, and while finding a great mascara at a great price can seem difficult there are usually some classic products that will never let you down. L'Oreal Voluminous Original Mascara is definitely one of those products, so much so that even a celebrity makeup artist like Mario Dedivanovic likes to keep it in his makeup arsenal.</p><p><strong>You'd think that a product that costs under ten dollars would have a tough time competing with a lot of the high-end offerings, but Voluminous mascara can give you a high-end red carpet look for a drugstore price.</strong></p><p>And mascara might seem like one of the simplest steps in your makeup routine, but a great lash look can mean the difference between an okay makeup day and an amazing makeup day. And aside from being cheap, this mascara is also one of the easiest products to find on this list, since it's sold nearly everywhere that makeup is sold!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clarisonic-sonic-foundation-makeup-brush-35>Clarisonic Sonic Foundation Makeup Brush $35</h2><p>As far as inexpensive beauty products go, a Clarisonic isn't the kind of beauty tool that is within most people's normal beauty budget. And even when it comes to beauty brushes, $35 dollars is definitely on the high end of affordable. However if you are already a proud owner of a Clarisonic face brush, then investing in the Clarisonic makeup brush head might be worth the money. When it comes to a professional looking makeup application the Clarisonic makeup brush is hard to beat, both because it's super easy to use and because it blends out product so flawlessly that you'll look like you've been airbrushed in real life.</p><p><strong>According to Mario, there is really no makeup tool that will give you a better look, and presumably he has tried every beauty tool under the sun already.</strong></p><p>If Clarisonic products are out of your price range then don't worry, there are still plenty of great products you can use to make your makeup look fantastic, but if it's an option for you then this is a great one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=l-oreal-24-hour-infallible-eye-shadow-8>L'Oreal 24 Hour Infallible Eye Shadow $8</h2><p>If you're a makeup beginner then working with an eye shadow palette is probably the easiest way to get your feet wet, but if you know what you like and are looking for some eye shadows that really pack a punch then look no further than the L'Oreal 24 Hour Infallible eye shadows. These individual high shine shadows come in nearly every color in the rainbow, and they're designed to deliver strong color payoffs that stick around through thick and thin. They're waterproof, fade resistant, and crease resistant, which means that you can create a super glam red carpet look that will stay looking fab for as long as you need it to. These vibrant shades certainly aren't designed with the shrinking violet kind of girls in mind, so if you're looking for a super intense Kardashian level eye look without having to break your bank then this line of shadows might be just what you're looking for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ardell-false-lashes-8>Ardell False Lashes $8</h2><p>When it comes to that signature Kim Kardashian makeup look obviously one of the permanent cornerstones is having lush, fluttery eyelashes to make the eye look really pop. And you'd think that it might take some luxury products in order to create that super intense falsie look, but fantastic, professional looking fake eyelashes are actually a lot more affordable than you might think.</p><p><strong>Ardell brand eyelashes are a perennial favorite of makeup gurus and artists, including Kim K's personal makeup artist Mario, and they're a shockingly affordable option that will make it look like you're a makeup pro.</strong></p><p>The demi wispies are a super popular choice for any eye look, but Ardell has a huge variety of styles and options, so you're almost guaranteed to find a pair that matches the exact look that you're going for. And luckily these inexpensive quality falsies are some of the easiest fake eyelashes to find, they're available at most drugstores, beauty supply stores, and even major chains like Target or Walmart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=redken-control-addict-28-hairspray-16-50>Redken Control Addict 28 Hairspray $16.50</h2><p>If you want to look super glamorous and put together then obviously having a flawlessly executed makeup look is an essential part of that, but if you're rocking some awesome makeup but don't have equally fabulous looking hair then the whole thing can kind of fall apart. But luckily creating a hairstyle that looks finished and polished is pretty easy to do on your own, and sometimes doesn't require all that much styling even. Obviously Kim Kardashian tends to favor looks where her hair is down and looks like it's been minimally styled, and while I'm sure her hairstylist puts in a massive amount of effort to make it look so effortless it's possible for anyone to pretty closely duplicate that look, or at least create an easy hair look that will look great on you personally. So next time you're at CVS or Rite Aid, pick up this Redken Control Addict Hairspray. Mario Dedivanovic swears by it and says it's one of the mainstays of his makeup kit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=precision-tips-q-tips-8-97>Precision Tips Q-Tips $8.97</h2><p>When most people think of beauty essentials that no one should be living without, cotton swabs are probably not the kind of beauty essential that immediately comes to mind. But sometimes it's the simplest tools that can make the biggest difference, and Q-Tip's precision tips cotton swabs are something that Kim K's makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic says that he really can't go without. What Dedivanovic says he likes to use these pointy cotton swabs for is super precise and delicate makeup mistake corrections, and it's easy to see why these super thrifty drugstore tools might make cosmetic clean-ups really easy without making you restart a whole look or destroying the work you've already put into your makeup for the day.</p><p><strong>These are an especially helpful little tool if you're inexperienced with makeup application or want to experiment with techniques and looks that you haven't tried before, since they're cheap and disposable and can pinpoint your makeup application really easily.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=l-oreal-true-match-super-blendable-makeup-10-95>L'Oreal True Match Super Blendable Makeup $10.95</h2><p>One of the simplest mistakes to make when pulling together a makeup look is wearing foundation that isn't a good match for your natural skin tone, which is why L'Oreal's True Match line is a great and inexpensive solution to this small problem that can have a major effect on how you look. True Match liquid foundations are blendable and buildable, so whether you want to go for a natural look or really get some strong coverage you can make it work without looking like you're wearing a pound of makeup.</p><p><strong>True Match really lives up to its name; aside from having one of the widest foundation color ranges at the drugstore, the foundations are also categorized by undertone, so if you're warm, cool, or neutral you'll be able to find a foundation that's the right fit for you.</strong></p><p>If you're still unsure of what your perfect match might be, hit up a beauty store that carries drugstore options like Ulta and just ask for some assistance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maybelline-fit-me-matte-and-poreless-foundation-8>Maybelline Fit Me Matte and Poreless Foundation $8</h2><p>Most people don't associate drugstore makeup with decent quality and a wide variety of options, but most major drugstore beauty brands have upped their game in a huge way in the past few years. Maybelline is one of the biggest mainstays on the drugstore beauty market, and one of their newer superstar products is their Fit Me Matte and Poreless foundation. Aside from offering one of the widest shade ranges in the market at 40 shades and counting, the Fit Me foundation offers a flawless matte finish that will look great and hold up for your entire day. While matte isn't exactly what you think of when you think of the classic Kim Kardashian makeup look, starting with a solid matte foundation that you can build your entire look on is an easy way of getting a complex and dimensional makeup look without going overboard or having to worry about looking so dewy and shiny that your skin looks oily instead of glowing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maybelline-fit-me-concealer-6-49>Maybelline Fit Me Concealer $6.49</h2><p>Maybelline's Fit Me concealer is a great, inexpensive concealer option if you're looking for concealer with a good amount of coverage and a nice, natural looking finish. This concealer comes in 12 different shades that run the gamut of super light to pretty dark, and it's a product that you can build up for better coverage that won't wind up looking cakey or creasing after a few hours of wear (and if you want to truly go for a Kim Kardashian level of concealer coverage and you aren't afraid of trying something new, look up some YouTube tutorials on how to "bake" your under eye concealer to get a super high level of coverage that won't look like you're wearing a pound of cover0up). If you're looking for a drugstore concealer that can compete with more expensive department store or Sephora options then look no further, Fit Me is probably the right fit for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nyx-mega-shine-lipgloss-5>NYX Mega Shine Lipgloss $5</h2><p>A good glossy lip is always a great addition to a solid makeup look, whether or not you're going for a fresh and natural look or an all out Hollywood glam look. And if you're looking for an inexpensive lip product that looks expensive, going for something from NYX cosmetics is probably a really good bet.</p><p><strong>They have a vast array of lip products that are super inexpensive but almost universally beloved, and their&nbsp;many&nbsp;glosses look great on your lips and feel great enough that you'll want to be wearing them all day.</strong></p><p>Even the nicest&nbsp;lipsticks won't look great if your lips aren't feeling great, so going for a gloss like NYX's glosses that look nice but also keep your lips feeling moisturized and comfortable are a super easy and cheap way of killing two birds with one stone. You can add one of these glosses to a full-out makeup look, or just toss one in your bag for day-to-day use.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=l-oreal-true-match-lumi-liquid-highlighter-13>L'Oreal True Match Lumi Liquid Highlighter $13</h2><p>If you're on the market for a nice drugstore liquid highlighter then L'Oreal's True Match Lumi liquid highlighter might be just what you're looking for. Not only does this liquid formula make getting a classic Kardashian glow easier and less expensive than ever, but it can also be used for a really lovely all over shimmer that will make it look like you're glowing from within. Just add a few drops of this highlighter to your normal liquid foundation and mix them together before applying all over your face, and you'll instantly transform any matte foundations into a gorgeous dewy finish. And since these highlighters are a part of the True Match line you'll be able to choose the right look for you in a snap, because all True Match products are categorized by skin tone and undertone so even the most inexperienced makeup wearer will find the right shade for themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=milani-baked-blush-8>Milani Baked Blush $8</h2><p>No makeup look is complete without a decent rosy flush on your cheeks, and whether or not you're looking for something matte or shiny, peachy or pink, or anything in between, you can probably find a nice match for your look in a Milani baked blush. Because these blushes are baked you'll get a whole lot of color payoff out of the product, and the ultra fine powder will keep your flush looking soft and is practically mistake proof.</p><p><strong>These marbled blushes look super cool in the pan and look even nicer on the skin, and some of them have such a nice sheen to them that you can even skip the cheek highlight and just let the blush do all of the work.</strong></p><p>You get a lot of product for a pretty small expense, and these blushes can compete with a lot of high-end products (obviously they'd have to if they're makeup artist approved!).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=milani-bronzer-xl-10>Milani Bronzer XL $10</h2><p>If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive bronzer that you can get a whole lot of mileage out of then look no further than the very aptly named Milani Bronzer XL. This dual colored bronzer comes in a huge pan with a different shade on either side, so you can create a dimensional bronzing look that can work for any day, time, and event that you might need it for. The bronzer also comes in three different shades, so finding something that suits your skin tone and undertone shouldn't be too difficult. The warmth and slight shimmer of the bronzers mean that they're not quite the kind of product you'd like to use to do some classic Kim K contouring, but it does mean that they're perfect for adding a bit of extra life to your makeup look and giving you a more natural looking sun-kissed glow that will rival that of any California girl.</p><h2 id=physician-s-formula-shimmer-strips-11-95>Physician's Formula Shimmer Strips $11.95</h2><p>If you're looking for a fabulous shimmering eye look that won't break the bank, then Physician's Formula shimmer strips might be right up your alley. The line is one of the most popular items in the Physician's Formula brand, for good reason, and that means that you can find a color palette for nearly any style or skin tone you could possibly be looking for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>What's great about these eye shadow palettes is that a lot of the individual shades can do double duty, so whether you're looking for an eye shadow look with dimensional shine or just need to dab on some extra shimmer somewhere in your makeup look, then one of these palettes could be all you need.</strong></p><p>Most of the palettes feature a wide variety of colors that have been curated to make a natural glam hybrid makeup look easier than ever, and since it's Physician's Formula you know that you don't need to worry about dusting it anywhere you like!</p><h2 id=physician-s-formula-powder-palette-mineral-glow-pearls-13-95>Physician's Formula Powder Palette Mineral Glow Pearls $13.95</h2><p>Obviously when it comes to makeup technique, Kim Kardashian and her makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic are probably best known for Kim's flawless contouring technique, but if you're looking for a fresh and dewy glow then you definitely don't want to skimp on a good highlighter. Physician's Formula is all about creating a good makeup look that will also keep the skin underneath healthy and soothed, and if you're looking for a luxury makeup experience at drugstore prices there's really no better option.
