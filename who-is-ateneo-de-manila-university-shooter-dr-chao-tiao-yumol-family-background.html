The three people have been identified as Rosita Furigay, former mayor of a Lamitan town in the southern Basilan province, her aide, Victor George, and a university guard, Jeneven Balandia.&nbsp;</p><p>Furigay's daughter, Hannah, was also shot and sustained severe injuries, but after being rushed to a local hospital, she survived her wounds. The assailant was taken into custody at the university gate, trying to flee the scene. According to the authorities, he was armed with two pistols when he was arrested.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=ateneo-de-manila-universi>Ateneo de Manila University Shooter Dr. Chao Tiao Yumol's Motives</h2><p>Dr. Chao Tiao Yumol is reported to have shot Rosita Furigay because he held a grudge against she did not do much to stop the spread of illegal drugs.</p><p>Yumol is a physician and a resident of Basilan. Authorities further stated that Furigay allegedly ordered the closure of his clinic in Lamitan City.&nbsp;</p><p>Various news outlets have identified Yumol as a hard right-wing believer, a passionate supporter of Bongbong Marcos, the current Filipino politician, and an online troll.</p><p>Bongbong Marcos is the son of Ferdinand Marcos Sr, who ruled the country from 1965 to 1986, and the country lived under martial law for half of his run. Yumol's views online seem to be a celebration of Marcos and putting down any female politicians.&nbsp;</p><p>[image-1]</p><p>Authorities also recently revealed that Yumol reportedly faces 26 cybercrime charges in Zamboanga City. Yumol's online trolling and bullying were also reported on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>The mixture of Yumol's political leanings, support of Marcos, and his seemingly personal hatred of Furigay gave him enough reason to attack the politician in the university's parking lot and kill three people. Still, the exact motive for his attacks is unclear, and the authorities are trying to determine it.</p><p>Yumol is currently being detained at Camp Karingal in Quezon City.</p><h2 id=ateneo-de-manila-universi>Ateneo de Manila University Shooter Dr. Chao Tiao Yumol's Background, In His Own Words</h2><p>Cr. Chao Tiao Yumol was a physician and ran a drug store.</p><p>However, according to him, this all changed when Lamitan major Rosita Furigay shut down his store. Yumol claims that she, her entire family, and drug lords are attempting to bring illegal drugs into the Basilan province to fund her family's evil deeds.</p><p>After losing his store, Yumol decided to do his investigation online into this supposed illegal drug trade that ended up being nothing more than online trolling and cyberbullying in most people's eyes. This online activity eventually led to him being arrested by the police for over 26 counts of cyber libel maligning government workers on social media.</p><p>However, in Yumol's eyes, these arrests were because he had exposed corruption and the drug industry in which Rosita Furigay was involved. The arrest only solidified his resolve.</p><p>He was released soon after and again tried to take matters into his own hands when in January 2021, he complained to the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission led by Greco Belgica, which accused local officials and especially Furigay, but they dismissed it because of a lack of evidence.</p><p>It was then he decided to take matters into his own hands.</p><h2 id=dr-chao-tiao-yumols-famil>Dr. Chao Tiao Yumol's Family</h2><p>Dr. Chao Tiao Yumol's Family has not come forward and made any statements about his arrest.</p><p>However, if his Facebook page is anything to go by, he has more than enough supporters who applaud his heinous acts. If anything, the public reaction to Yumol's actions showcases the deep political divide that the Philippines is facing right now.</p><p>The police have not released what will happen to Yumol yet, but sadly, he got what he wanted. The people have begun to notice him and talk about him, and soon enough, a bunch of radicals who agree with him will follow his lead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiuoaddnsBurdOepZ6nXZmybrnAp6ClmV2qu6rCxKuqoqypYsCpu86tnKtllKd6pLTAqGStoZGkerrBzKijZp6RoratxYybmJyjl6e8trrD</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-ateneo-de-manila-university-shooter-dr-chao-tiao-yumol-family-background.html&text=Who%20Is%20Ateneo%20de%20Manila%20University%20Shooter%20Dr%20Chao%20Tiao%20Yumol%3f%20His%20Family%20Background%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-ateneo-de-manila-university-shooter-dr-chao-tiao-yumol-family-background.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-ateneo-de-manila-university-shooter-dr-chao-tiao-yumol-family-background.html&title=Who%20Is%20Ateneo%20de%20Manila%20University%20Shooter%20Dr%20Chao%20Tiao%20Yumol%3f%20His%20Family%20Background%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-ateneo-de-manila-university-shooter-dr-chao-tiao-yumol-family-background.html&title=Who%20Is%20Ateneo%20de%20Manila%20University%20Shooter%20Dr%20Chao%20Tiao%20Yumol%3f%20His%20Family%20Background%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-ateneo-de-manila-university-shooter-dr-chao-tiao-yumol-family-background.html&title=Who%20Is%20Ateneo%20de%20Manila%20University%20Shooter%20Dr%20Chao%20Tiao%20Yumol%3f%20His%20Family%20Background%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-ateneo-de-manila-university-shooter-dr-chao-tiao-yumol-family-background.html&description=Who%20Is%20Ateneo%20de%20Manila%20University%20Shooter%20Dr%20Chao%20Tiao%20Yumol%3f%20His%20Family%20Background%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christina-carlin-kraft.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Carlin-Kraft">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-did-steve-howey-divorce-sarah-shahi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened Between Steve Howey And Ex-Wife Sarah Shahi?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
